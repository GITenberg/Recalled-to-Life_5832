    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; UNA CALLINGHAM&rsquo;S FIRST RECOLLECTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      It may sound odd to say so, but the very earliest fact that impressed
      itself on my memory was a scene that took place&mdash;so I was told&mdash;when
      I was eighteen years old, in my father&rsquo;s house, The Grange, at
      Woodbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      My babyhood, my childhood, my girlhood, my school-days were all utterly
      blotted out by that one strange shock of horror. My past life became
      exactly as though it had never been. I forgot my own name. I forgot my
      mother-tongue. I forgot everything I had ever done or known or thought
      about. Except for the power to walk and stand and perform simple actions
      of every-day use, I became a baby in arms again, with a nurse to take care
      of me. The doctors told me, later, I had fallen into what they were
      pleased to call &ldquo;a Second State.&rdquo; I was examined and reported
      upon as a Psychological Curiosity. But at the time, I knew nothing of all
      this. A thunderbolt, as it were, destroyed at one blow every relic, every
      trace of my previous existence; and I began life all over again, with that
      terrible scene of blood as my first birthday and practical starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember it all even now with horrible distinctness. Each item in it
      photographed itself vividly on my mind&rsquo;s eye. I saw it as in a
      picture&mdash;just as clearly, just as visually. And the effect, now I
      look back upon it with a maturer judgment, was precisely like a photograph
      in another way too. It was wholly unrelated in time and space: it stood
      alone by itself, lighted up by a single spark, without rational connection
      before or after it. What led up to it all, I hadn&rsquo;t the very
      faintest idea. I only knew the Event itself took place; and I, like a
      statue, stood rooted in the midst of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was the Picture as, for many long months, it presented itself
      incessantly to my startled brain, by day and by night, awake or asleep, in
      colours more distinct than words can possibly paint them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw myself standing in a large, square room&mdash;a very handsome old
      room, filled with bookshelves like a library. On one side stood a table,
      and on the table a box. A flash of light rendered the whole scene visible.
      But it wasn&rsquo;t light that came in through the window. It was rather
      like lightning, so quick it was, and clear, and short-lived, and terrible.
      Half-way to the door, I stood and looked in horror at the sight revealed
      before my eyes by that sudden flash. A man lay dead in a little pool of
      blood that gurgled by short jets from a wound on his left breast. I didn&rsquo;t
      even know at the moment the man was my father; though slowly, afterward,
      by the concurrent testimony of others, I learnt to call him so. But his
      relationship wasn&rsquo;t part of the Picture to me. There, he was only in
      my eyes a man&mdash;a man well past middle age, with a long white beard,
      now dabbled with the thick blood that kept gurgling so hatefully from the
      red spot in his waistcoat. He lay on his back, half-curled round toward
      one arm, exactly as he fell. And the revolver he had been shot with lay on
      the ground not far from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that wasn&rsquo;t all the Picture. The murderer was there as well as
      the victim. Besides the table, and the box, and the wounded man, and the
      pistol, I saw another figure behind, getting out of the window. It was the
      figure of a man, I should say about twenty-five or thirty: he had just
      raised himself to the ledge, and was poising to leap; for the room, as I
      afterwards learned, though on the ground floor, stood raised on a basement
      above the garden behind. I couldn&rsquo;t see the man&rsquo;s face, or any
      part of him, indeed, except his stooping back, and his feet, and his neck,
      and his elbows. But what little I saw was printed indelibly on the very
      fibre of my nature. I could have recognised that man anywhere if I saw him
      in the same attitude. I could have sworn to him in any court of justice on
      the strength of his back alone, so vividly did I picture it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tall and thin, but he stooped like a hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other points worth notice in that strange mental photograph.
      The man was well-dressed, and had the bearing of a gentleman. Looking back
      upon the scene long after, when I had learned once more what words and
      things meant, I could feel instinctively this was no common burglar, no
      vulgar murderer. Whatever might have been the man&rsquo;s object in
      shooting my father, I was certain from the very first it was not mere
      robbery. But at the time, I&rsquo;m confident, I never reasoned about his
      motives or his actions in any way. I merely took in the scene, as it were,
      passively, in a great access of horror, which rendered me incapable of
      sense or thought or speech or motion. I saw the table, the box, the
      apparatus by its side, the murdered man on the floor, the pistol lying
      pointed with its muzzle towards his body, the pool of blood that soaked
      deep into the Turkey carpet beneath, the ledge of the window, the young
      man&rsquo;s rounded back as he paused and hesitated. And I also saw, like
      an instantaneous flash, one hand pushed behind him, waving me off, I
      almost thought, with the gesture of one warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why didn&rsquo;t I remember the murderer&rsquo;s face? That puzzled me
      long after. I must have seen him before: I must surely have been there
      when the crime was committed. I must have known at the moment everything
      about it. But the blank that came over my memory, came over it with the
      fatal shot. All that went before, was to me as though it were not. I
      recollect vaguely, as the first point in my life, that my eyes were shut
      hard, and darkness came over me. While they were so shut, I heard an
      explosion. Next moment, I believe, I opened them, and saw this Picture. No
      sensitive-plate could have photographed it more instantaneously, as by an
      electric spark, than did my retina that evening, as for months after I saw
      it all. In another moment, I shut my lids again, and all was over. There
      was darkness once more, and I was alone with my Horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      In years then to come, I puzzled my head much as to the meaning of the
      Picture. Gradually, step by step, I worked some of it out, with the aid of
      my friends, and of the evidence tendered at the coroner&rsquo;s inquest.
      But for the moment I knew nothing of all that. I was a newborn baby again.
      Only with this important difference. They say our minds at birth are like
      a sheet of white paper, ready to take whatever impressions may fall upon
      them. Mine was like a sheet all covered and obscured by one hateful
      picture. It was weeks, I fancy, before I knew or was conscious of anything
      else but that. The Picture and a great Horror divided my life between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recollect, I didn&rsquo;t even remember the murdered man was my father. I
      didn&rsquo;t recognise the room as one in our own old house at Woodbury. I
      didn&rsquo;t know anything at all except what I tell you here. I saw the
      corpse, the blood, the box on the table, the wires by the side, the
      bottles and baths and plates of an amateur photographer&rsquo;s kit,
      without knowing what they all meant. I saw even the books not as books but
      as visible points of colour. It had something the effect on me that it
      might have upon anyone else to be dropped suddenly on the stage of a
      theatre at the very moment when a hideous crime was being committed, and
      to believe it real, or rather, to know it by some vague sense as hateful
      and actual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here my history began. I date from that Picture. My second babyhood was
      passed in the shadow of the abiding Horror.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; BEGINNING LIFE AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      What happened after is far more vague to me. Compared with the vividness
      of that one initial Picture, the events of the next few months have only
      the blurred indistinctness of all childish memories. For I was a child
      once more, in all save stature, and had to learn to remember things just
      like other children.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will try to tell the whole tale over again exactly as it then struck me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Picture, I told you, I shut my eyes in alarm for a second. When
      I opened them once more there was a noise, a very great noise, and my
      recollection is that people had burst wildly into the room, and were
      lifting the dead body, and bending over it in astonishment, and speaking
      loud to me, and staring at me. I believe they broke the door open, though
      that&rsquo;s rather inference than memory; I learnt it afterwards. Soon
      some of them rushed to the open window and looked out into the garden.
      Then, suddenly, a man gave a shout, and leaping on to the sill, jumped
      down in pursuit, as I thought, of the murderer. As time went on, more
      people flocked in; and some of them looked at the body and the pool of
      blood; and some of them turned round and spoke to me. But what they said
      or what they meant I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea. The noise of the
      pistol-shot still rang loud in my ears: the ineffable Horror still drowned
      all my senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, another man came in, with an air of authority, and felt my
      pulse and my brow, and lifted me on to a sofa. But I didn&rsquo;t even
      remember there was such a thing as a doctor. I lay there for a while,
      quite dazed; and the man, who was kindly-looking and close-shaven and
      fatherly, gave me something in a glass: after which he turned round and
      examined the body. He looked hard at the revolver, too, and chalked its
      place on the ground. Then I saw no more, for two women lifted me in their
      arms and took me up to bed; and with that, the first scene of my childhood
      seemed to end entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay in bed for a day or two, during which time I was dimly aware of much
      commotion going on here and there in the house; and the doctor came night
      and morning, and tended me carefully. I suppose I may call him the doctor
      now, though at the time I didn&rsquo;t call him so&mdash;I knew him merely
      as a visible figure. I don&rsquo;t believe I THOUGHT at all during those
      earliest days, or gave things names in any known language. They rather
      passed before me dreamily in long procession, like a vague panorama. When
      people spoke to me, it was like the sound of a foreign tongue. I attached
      no more importance to anything they said than to the cawing of the rooks
      in the trees by the rectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of five days, the doctor came once more, and watched me a great
      deal, and spoke in a low voice with a woman in a white cap and a clean
      white apron who waited on me daily. As soon as he was gone, my nurse, as I
      learned afterwards to call her,&mdash;it&rsquo;s so hard not to drop into
      the language of everyday life when one has to describe things to other
      people,&mdash;my nurse got me up, with much ado and solemnity, and dressed
      me in a new black frock, very dismal and ugly, and put on me a black hat,
      with a dreary-looking veil; and took me downstairs, with the aid of a man
      who wore a suit of blue clothes and a queer kind of helmet. The man was of
      the sort I now call a policeman. These pictures are far less definite in
      my mind than the one that begins my second life; but still, in a vague
      kind of way, I pretty well remember them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ground floor, nurse made me walk; and I walked out to the door,
      where a cab was in waiting, drawn slowly by a pair of horses. People were
      looking on, on either side, between the door and the cab&mdash;great
      crowds of people, peering eagerly forward; and two more men in blue suits
      were holding them off by main force from surging against me and
      incommoding me. I don&rsquo;t think they wanted to hurt me: it was rather
      curiosity than anger I saw in their faces. But I was afraid, and shrank
      back. They were eager to see me, however, and pressed forward with loud
      cries, so that the men in blue suits had hard work to prevent them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know now there were two reasons why they wanted to see me. I was the
      murdered man&rsquo;s daughter, and I was a Psychological Phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove away, through green lanes, in the cab, nurse and I; and in spite
      of the Horror, which surrounded me always, and the Picture, which recurred
      every time I shut my eyes to think, I enjoyed that drive very much, with
      all the fresh vividness of childish pleasure. Though I learnt later I was
      eighteen years old at least, I was in my inner self just like a baby of
      ten months, going ta-ta. At the end of the drive, we drew up sharp at a
      house, where some more men stood about, with red bands on their caps, and
      took boxes from the cab and put them into a van, while nurse and I got
      into a different carriage, drawn quickly by a thing that went puff-puff,
      puff-puff. I didn&rsquo;t know it was a railway, and yet in a way I did. I
      half forgot, half remembered it. Things that I&rsquo;d seen in my previous
      state seemed to come back to me, in fact, as soon as I saw them; or at
      least to be more familiar to me than things I&rsquo;d never seen before.
      Especially afterwards. But while things were remembered, persons, I found
      by-and-by, were completely forgotten. Or rather, while I remembered after
      a while generalities, such as houses and men, recognising them in the
      abstract as a house, or a man, or a horse, or a baby, I forgot entirely
      particulars, such as the names of people and the places I had lived in.
      Words soon came back to me: names and facts were lost: I knew the world as
      a whole, not my own old part in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, not to make my story too long in these early childish stages, we
      went on the train, as it seemed to me, a long way across fields to Aunt
      Emma&rsquo;s. I didn&rsquo;t know she was Aunt Emma then for, indeed, I
      had never seen her before; but I remember arriving there at her pretty
      little cottage, and seeing a sweet old lady&mdash;barely sixty, I should
      say, but with smooth white hair,&mdash;who stood on the steps of the house
      and cried like a child, and held out her hands to me, and hugged me and
      kissed me. And it was there that I learned my first word. A great many
      times over, she spoke about &ldquo;Una.&rdquo; She said it so often, I
      caught vaguely at the sound. And nurse, when she answered her, said
      &ldquo;Una&rdquo; also. Then, when Aunt Emma called me, she always said
      &ldquo;Una.&rdquo; So it came to me dimly that Una meant ME. But I didn&rsquo;t
      exactly recollect it had been my name before, though I learned in due time
      afterwards that I&rsquo;d always been called so. However, just at first, I
      picked up the word as a child might pick it up; and when, some months
      later, I began to talk easily, I spoke of myself always in the third
      person as Una. I can remember with a smile now how I went one day to Aunt
      Emma&mdash;I, a great girl of eighteen&mdash;and held up my skirt, that I&rsquo;d
      muddied in the street, and said to her, with great gravity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una naughty girl: Una got her frock wet. Aunt Emma going to scold
      poor Una for being so naughty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that I often smiled, in those days; for, in spite of Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
      kindness, my second girlhood, like my first, was a very unhappy one. The
      Horror and the Picture pursued me too close. It was months and months
      before I could get rid for a moment of that persistent nightmare. And yet
      I had everything else on earth to make me happy. Aunt Emma lived in a
      pretty east-coast town, with high bracken-clad downs, and breezy common
      beyond; while in front stretched great sands, where I loved to race about
      and to play cricket and tennis. It was the loveliest town that ever you
      saw in your life, with a broken chancel to the grand old church, and a
      lighthouse on a hill, with delicious views to seaward. The doctor had sent
      me there (I know now) as soon as I was well enough to move, in order to
      get me away from the terrible associations of The Grange at Woodbury. As
      long as I lived in the midst of scenes which would remind me of poor
      father, he said, and of his tragical death, there was no hope of my
      recovery. The only chance for me to regain what I had lost in that moment
      of shock was complete change of air, of life, of surroundings. Aunt Emma,
      for her part, was only too glad to take me in: and as poor papa had died
      intestate, Aunt Emma was now, of course, my legal guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was my mother&rsquo;s sister, I learned as time went on; and there had
      been feud while he lived between her and my father. Why, I couldn&rsquo;t
      imagine. She was the sweetest old soul I ever knew, indeed, and what on
      earth he could have quarrelled with her about I never could fathom. She
      tended me so carefully that as months went by, the Horror began to
      decrease and my soul to become calm again. I grew gradually able to remain
      in a room alone for a few minutes at a time, and to sleep at night in a
      bed by myself, if only there was a candle, and nurse was in another bed in
      the same room close by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet every now and again a fresh shivering fit came on. At such times I
      would cover my head with the bedclothes and cower, and see the Picture
      even so floating visibly in mid-air like a vision before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second education must have been almost as much of a business as my
      first had been, only rather less longsome. I had first to relearn the
      English language, which came back to me by degrees, much quicker, of
      course, than I had picked it up in my childhood. Then I had to begin again
      with reading, writing, and arithmetic&mdash;all new to me in a way, and
      all old in another. Whatever I learned and whatever I read seemed novel
      while I learned it, but familiar the moment I had thoroughly grasped it.
      To put it shortly, I could remember nothing of myself, but I could recall
      many things, after a time, as soon as they were told me clearly. The
      process was rather a process of reminding than of teaching, properly so
      called. But it took some years for me to recall things, even when I was
      reminded of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent four years at Aunt Emma&rsquo;s, growing gradually to my own age
      again. At the end of that time I was counted a girl of twenty-two, much
      like any other. But I was older than my age; and the shadow of the Horror
      pursued me incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that time I knew, too, from what I heard said in the house that my
      father&rsquo;s murderer had never been caught, and that nobody even knew
      who he was, or anything definite about him. The police gave him up as an
      uncaught criminal. He was still at large, and might always be so. I knew
      this from vague hints and from vague hints alone; for whenever I tried to
      ask, I was hushed up at once with an air of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, dearest,&rdquo; Aunt Emma would say, in her quiet fashion,
      &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t talk about that night. I have Dr. Wade&rsquo;s
      strict orders that nothing must be said to you about it, and above all
      nothing that could in any way excite or arouse you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was fain to keep my peace; for though Aunt Emma was kind, she ruled
      me still in all things like a little girl, as I was when I came to her.

      CHAPTER III. &mdash; AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning, after I&rsquo;d been four whole years at Aunt Emma&rsquo;s, I
      heard a ring at the bell, and, looking over the stairs, saw a tall and
      handsome man in a semi-military coat, who asked in a most audible voice
      for Miss Callingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria, the housemaid, hesitated a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Callingham&rsquo;s in, sir,&rdquo; she answered in a somewhat
      dubious tone; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to let you see
      her or not. My mistress is out; and I&rsquo;ve strict orders that no
      strangers are to call on Miss Callingham when her aunt&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she held the door ajar in her hand undecidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall man smiled, and seemed to me to slip a coin quietly into Maria&rsquo;s
      palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; he answered, with unobtrusive
      persistence; &ldquo;I thought Miss Moore was out. That&rsquo;s just why I&rsquo;ve
      come. I&rsquo;m an officer from Scotland Yard, and I want to see Miss
      Callingham&mdash;alone&mdash;most particularly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria drew herself up and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart stood still within me at this chance of enlightenment. I guessed
      what he meant; so I called over the stairs to her, in a tremor of
      excitement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show the gentleman into the drawing-room, Maria. I &lsquo;ll come
      down to him at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For I was dying to know the explanation of the Picture that haunted me so
      persistently; and as nobody at home would ever tell me anything worth
      knowing about it, I thought this was as good an opportunity as I could get
      for making a beginning towards the solution of the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I ran into my own room as quick as quick could be, and set my front
      hair straight, and slipped on a hat and jacket (for I was in my morning
      dress), and then went down to the drawing-room to see the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose as I entered. He was a gentleman, I felt at once. His manner was
      as deferential, as kind, and as considerate to my sensitiveness, as
      anything it&rsquo;s possible for you to imagine in anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have to trouble you, Miss Callingham,&rdquo; he
      said, with a very gentle smile; &ldquo;but I daresay you can understand
      yourself the object of my visit. I could have wished to come in a more
      authorised way; but I&rsquo;ve been in correspondence with Miss Moore for
      some time past as to the desirability of reopening the inquiry with regard
      to your father&rsquo;s unfortunate death; and I thought the time might now
      have arrived when it would be possible to put a few questions to you
      personally upon that unhappy subject. Miss Moore objected to my plan. She
      thought it would still perhaps be prejudicial to your health&mdash;a point
      in which Dr. Wade, I must say, entirely agrees with her. Nevertheless, in
      the interests of Justice, as the murderer is still at large, I&rsquo;ve
      ventured to ask you for this interview; because what I read in the
      newspapers about the state of your health&mdash;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I interrupted him, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you read in the newspapers about the state of my health!&rdquo;
      I repeated, thunderstruck. &ldquo;Why, surely they don&rsquo;t put the
      state of MY health in the newspapers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For I didn&rsquo;t know then I was a Psychological Phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector smiled blandly, and pulling out his pocket-book, selected a
      cutting from a pile that apparently all referred to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken,&rdquo; he said, briefly. &ldquo;The
      newspapers, on the contrary, have treated your case at great length. See,
      here&rsquo;s the latest report. That&rsquo;s clipped from last Wednesday&rsquo;s
      Telegraph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered then that a paragraph of just that size had been carefully
      cut out of Wednesday&rsquo;s paper before I was allowed by Aunt Emma to
      read it. Aunt Emma always glanced over the paper first, indeed, and often
      cut out such offending paragraphs. But I never attached much importance to
      their absence before, because I thought it was merely a little fussy
      result of auntie&rsquo;s good old English sense of maidenly modesty. I
      supposed she merely meant to spare my blushes. I knew girls were often
      prevented on particular days from reading the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now I seized the paragraph he handed me, and read it with deep
      interest. It was the very first time I had seen my own name in a printed
      newspaper. I didn&rsquo;t know then how often it had figured there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paragraph was headed, &ldquo;THE WOODBURY MURDER,&rdquo; and it ran
      something like this, as well as I can remember it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are still hopes that the miscreant who shot Mr. Vivian
      Callingham at The Grange, at Woodbury, some four years since, may be
      tracked down and punished at last for his cowardly crime. It will be fresh
      in everyone&rsquo;s memory, as one of the most romantic episodes in that
      extraordinary tragedy, that at the precise moment of her father&rsquo;s
      death, Miss Callingham, who was present in the room during the attack, and
      who alone might have been a witness capable of recognising or describing
      the wretched assailant, lost her reason on the spot, owing to the
      appalling shock to her nervous system, and remained for some months in an
      imbecile condition. Gradually, as we have informed our readers from time
      to time, Miss Callingham&rsquo;s intellect has become stronger and
      stronger; and though she is still totally unable to remember spontaneously
      any events that occurred before her father&rsquo;s death, it is hoped it
      may be possible, by describing vividly certain trains of previous
      incidents, to recall them in some small degree to her imperfect memory.
      Dr. Thornton, of Welbeck Street, who has visited her from time to time on
      behalf of the Treasury, in conjunction with Dr. Wade, her own medical
      attendant, went down to Barton-on-the-Sea on Monday, and once more
      examined Miss Callingham&rsquo;s intellect. Though the Doctor is
      judiciously reticent as to the result of his visit, it is generally
      believed at Barton that he thinks the young lady sufficiently recovered to
      undergo a regular interrogatory; and in spite of the fact that Dr. Wade is
      opposed to any such proceeding at present, as prejudicial to the lady&rsquo;s
      health, it is not unlikely that the Treasury may act upon their own
      medical official&rsquo;s opinion, and send down an Inspector from Scotland
      Yard to make inquiries direct on the subject from Miss Callingham in
      person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My head swam round. It was all like a dream to me. I held my forehead with
      my hands, and gazed blankly at the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand what all this means?&rdquo; he said interrogatively,
      leaning forward as he spoke. &ldquo;You remember the murder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; I answered him, trembling all over. &ldquo;I
      remember every detail of it. I could describe you exactly all the objects
      in the room. The Picture it left behind has burned itself into my brain
      like a flash of lightning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector drew his chair nearer. &ldquo;Now, Miss Callingham,&rdquo;
      he said in a very serious voice, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a remarkable
      expression&mdash;like a flash of lightning.&rsquo; Bear in mind, this is a
      matter of life and death to somebody somewhere. Somebody&rsquo;s neck may
      depend upon your answers. Will you tell me exactly how much you remember?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him in a few words precisely how the scene had imprinted itself on
      my memory. I recalled the room, the box, the green wires, the carpet; the
      man who lay dead in his blood on the floor; the man who stood poised ready
      to leap from the window. He let me go on unchecked till I&rsquo;d finished
      everything I had to say spontaneously. Then he took a photograph from his
      pocket, which he didn&rsquo;t show me. Looking at it attentively, he asked
      me questions, one by one, about the different things in the room at the
      time in very minute detail: Where exactly was the box? How did it stand
      relatively to the unlighted lamp? What was the position of the pistol on
      the floor? In which direction was my father&rsquo;s head lying? Though it
      brought back the Horror to me in a fuller and more terrible form than
      ever, I answered all his questions to the very best of my ability. I could
      picture the whole scene like a photograph to myself; and I didn&rsquo;t
      doubt the object he held in his hand was a photograph of the room as it
      appeared after the murder. He checked my statements, one by one as I went
      on, by reference to the photograph, murmuring half to himself now and
      again: &ldquo;Yes, yes, exactly so&rdquo;; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&rdquo;;
      &ldquo;That was so,&rdquo; at each item I mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of these inquiries, he paused and looked hard at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miss Callingham,&rdquo; he said again, peering deep into my
      eyes, &ldquo;I want you to concentrate your mind very much, not on this
      Picture you carry so vividly in your own brain, but on the events that
      went immediately before and after it. Pause long and think. Try hard to
      remember. And first, you say there was a great flash of light. Now, answer
      me this: was it one flash alone, or had there been several?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped and racked my brain. Blank, blank, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; I faltered out, longing terribly to
      cry. &ldquo;I can recall just that one scene, and nothing else in the
      world before it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me fixedly, jotting down a few words in his note-book as he
      looked. Then he spoke again, still more slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, try once more,&rdquo; he said, with an encouraging air.
      &ldquo;You saw this man&rsquo;s back as he was getting out of the window.
      But can&rsquo;t you remember having seen his face before? Had he a beard?
      a moustache? what eyes? what nose? Did you see the shot fired? And if so,
      what sort of person was the man who fired it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I searched the pigeon-holes of my memory in vain, as I had done a
      hundred times before by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; I cried helplessly, letting my hands drop
      by my side. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember a thing, except the Picture. I
      don&rsquo;t know whether I saw the shot fired or not. I don&rsquo;t know
      what the murderer looked like in the face. I&rsquo;ve told you all I know.
      I can recall nothing else. It&rsquo;s all a great blank to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector hesitated a moment, as if in doubt what step to take next.
      Then he drew himself up and said, still more gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This inability to assist us is really very singular. I had hoped,
      after Dr. Thornton&rsquo;s report, that we might at last count with some
      certainty upon arriving at fresh results as to the actual murder. I can
      see from what you tell me you&rsquo;re a young lady of intelligence&mdash;much
      above the average&mdash;and great strength of mind. It&rsquo;s curious
      your memory should fail you so pointedly just where we stand most in need
      of its aid. Recollect, nobody else but you ever saw the murderer&rsquo;s
      face. Now, I&rsquo;m going to presume you&rsquo;re answering me honestly,
      and try a bold means to arouse your dormant memory. Look hard, and hark
      back.&mdash;Is that the room you recollect? Is that the picture that still
      haunts and pursues you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed me the photograph he held in his fingers. I took it, all on
      fire. The sight almost made me turn sick with horror. To my awe and
      amazement, it was indeed the very scene I remembered so well. Only, of
      course, it was taken from another point of view, and represented things in
      rather different relative positions to those I figured them in. But it
      showed my father&rsquo;s body lying dead upon the floor; it showed his
      poor corpse weltering helpless in its blood; it showed myself, as a girl
      of eighteen, standing awestruck, gazing on in blank horror at the sight;
      and in the background, half blurred by the summer evening light, it showed
      the vague outline of a man&rsquo;s back, getting out of the window. On one
      side was the door: that formed no part of my mental picture, because it
      was at my back; but in the photograph it too was indistinct, as if in the
      very act of being burst open. The details were vague, in part&mdash;probably
      the picture had never been properly focussed;&mdash;but the main figures
      stood out with perfect clearness, and everything in the room was, allowing
      for the changed point of view, exactly as I remembered it in my persistent
      mental photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my Picture,&rdquo; I said, slowly. &ldquo;But it
      recalls to me nothing new. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector stared at me hard once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how that photograph was
      produced, and how it came into our possession?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I trembled violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I answered, reddening. &ldquo;But&mdash;I
      think it had something to do with the flash like lightning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector jumped at those words like a cat upon a mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he cried briskly, as one who at last, after
      long search, finds a hopeful clue where all seemed hopeless. &ldquo;It had
      to do with the flash. The flash produced it. This is a photograph taken by
      your father&rsquo;s process.... Of course you recollect your father&rsquo;s
      process?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He eyed me close. The words, as he spoke them, seemed to call up dimly
      some faint memory of my pre-natal days&mdash;of my First State, as I had
      learned from the doctors to call it. But his scrutiny made me shrink. I
      shut my eyes and looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; I said slowly, rummaging my memory half in vain,
      &ldquo;I remember something about it. It had something to do with
      photography, hadn&rsquo;t it?...No, no, with the electric light....I can&rsquo;t
      exactly remember which. Will you tell me all about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair, and, eyeing me all the time with that same
      watchful glance, began to describe to me in some detail an apparatus which
      he said my father had devised, for taking instantaneous photographs by the
      electric light, with a clockwork mechanism. It was an apparatus that let
      sensitive-plates revolve one after another opposite the lens of a camera;
      and as each was exposed, the clockwork that moved it produced an electric
      spark, so as to represent such a series of effects as the successive
      positions of a horse in trotting. My father, it seemed, was of a scientific
      turn, and had just perfected this new automatic machine before his sudden
      death. I listened with breathless interest; for up to that time I had
      never been allowed to hear anything about my father&mdash;anything about
      the great tragedy with which my second life began. It was wonderful to me
      even now to be allowed to speak and ask questions on it with anybody. So
      hedged about had I been all my days with mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I listened, I saw the Inspector could tell by the answering flash in my
      eye that his words recalled SOMETHING to me, however vaguely. As he
      finished, I leant forward, and with a very flushed face, that I could feel
      myself, I cried, in a burst of recollection:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. I remember. And the box on the table&mdash;the box that&rsquo;s
      in my mental picture, and is not in the photograph&mdash;THAT was the
      apparatus you&rsquo;ve just been describing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector turned upon me with a rapidity that fairly took my breath
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where are the other ones?&rdquo; he asked, pouncing down upon
      me quite fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other WHAT?&rdquo; I repeated, amazed; for I didn&rsquo;t
      really understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the other photographs!&rdquo; he replied, as if trying to
      surprise me. &ldquo;There must have been more, you know. It held six
      plates. Except for this one, the apparatus, when we found it, was empty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner seemed to crush out the faint spark of recollection that just
      flickered within me. I collapsed at once. I couldn&rsquo;t stand such
      brusqueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; I answered in despair.
      &ldquo;I never saw the plates. I know nothing about them.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE STORY OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Inspector scanned me close for a few minutes in silence. He seemed
      doubtful, suspicious. At last he made a new move. &ldquo;I believe you,
      Miss Callingham,&rdquo; he said, more gently. &ldquo;I can see this train
      of thought distresses you too much. But I can see, too, our best chance
      lies in supplying you with independent clues which you may work out for
      yourself. You must re-educate your memory. You want to know all about this
      murder, of course. Well, now, look over these papers. They&rsquo;ll tell
      you in brief what little we know about it. And they may succeed in
      striking afresh some resonant chord in your memory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed me a book of pasted newspaper paragraphs, interspersed here and
      there in red ink with little manuscript notes and comments. I began to
      read it with profound interest. It was so strange for me thus to learn for
      the first time the history of my own life; for I was quite ignorant as yet
      of almost everything about my First State, and my father and mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paragraphs told me the whole story of the crime, as far as it was
      known to the world, from the very beginning. First of all, in the papers,
      came the bald announcement that a murder had been committed in a country
      town in Staffordshire; and that the victim was Mr. Vivian Callingham, a
      gentleman of means, residing in his own house, The Grange, at Woodbury.
      Mr. Callingham was the inventor of the acmegraphic process. The servants,
      said the telegram to the London papers, had heard the sound of a
      pistol-shot, about half-past eight at night, coming from the direction of
      Mr. Callingham&rsquo;s library. Aroused by the report, they rushed hastily
      to the spot, and broke open the door, which was locked from within. As
      they did so, a horrible sight met their astonished eyes. Mr. Callingham&rsquo;s
      dead body lay extended on the ground, shot right through the heart, and
      weltering in its life-blood. Miss Callingham stood by his side, transfixed
      with horror, and mute in her agony. On the floor lay the pistol that had
      fired the fatal shot. And just as the servants entered, for one second of
      time, the murderer who was otherwise wholly unknown, was seen to leap from
      the window into the shrubbery below. The gardener rushed after him, and
      jumped down at the same spot. But the murderer had disappeared as if by
      magic. It was conjectured he must have darted down the road at full speed,
      vaulted the gate, which was usually locked, and made off at a rapid run
      for the open country. Up to date of going to press, the Telegraph said, he
      was still at large and had not been apprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the earliest account&mdash;bald, simple, unvarnished. Then came
      mysterious messages from the Central Press about the absence of any clue
      to identify the stranger. He hadn&rsquo;t entered the house by any regular
      way, it seemed; unless, indeed, Mr. Callingham had brought him home
      himself and let him in with the latchkey. None of the servants had opened
      the door that evening to any suspicious character; not a soul had they
      seen, nor did any of them know a man was with their master in the library.
      They heard voices, to be sure&mdash;voices, loud at times and angry,&mdash;but
      they supposed it was Mr. Callingham talking with his daughter. Till roused
      by the fatal pistol-shot, the gardener said, they had no cause for alarm.
      Even the footmarks the stranger might have left as he leaped from the
      window were obliterated by the prints of the gardener&rsquo;s boots as he
      jumped hastily after him. The only person who could cast any light upon
      the mystery at all was clearly Miss Callingham, who was in the room at the
      moment. But Miss Callingham&rsquo;s mind was completely unhinged for the
      present by the nervous shock she had received as her father fell dead
      before her. They must wait a few days till she recovered consciousness,
      and then they might confidently hope that the murderer would be
      identified, or at least so described that the police could track him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, I read the report of the coroner&rsquo;s inquest. The facts
      there elicited added nothing very new to the general view of the case.
      Only, the servants remarked on examination, there was a strange smell of
      chemicals in the room when they entered; and the doctors seemed to suggest
      that the smell might be that of chloroform, mixed with another very
      powerful drug known to affect the memory. Miss Callingham&rsquo;s present
      state, they thought, might thus perhaps in part be accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can&rsquo;t imagine how curious it was for me to see myself thus
      impersonally discussed at such a distance of time, or to learn so long
      after that for ten days or more I had been the central object of interest
      to all reading England. My name was bandied about without the slightest
      reserve. I trembled to see how cavalierly the press had treated me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went on, I began to learn more and more about my father. He had made
      money in Australia, it was said, and had come to live at Woodbury some
      fourteen years earlier, where my mother had died when I was a child of
      four; and some accounts said she was a widow of fortune. My father had
      been interested in chemistry and photography, it seemed, and had lately
      completed a new invention, the acmegraph, for taking successive
      photographs at measured intervals of so many seconds by electric light. He
      was a grave, stern man, the papers said, more feared than loved by his
      servants and neighbours; but nobody about was known to have a personal
      grudge against him. On the contrary, he lived at peace with all men. The
      motive for the murder remained to the end a complete mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second morning of the inquest, however, a curious thing happened.
      The police, it appeared, had sealed up the room where the murder took
      place, and allowed nobody to enter it till the inquiry was over. But after
      the jury came round to view the room, the policeman in charge found the
      window at the back of the house had been recently opened, and the box with
      the photographic apparatus had been stolen from the library. Till that
      moment nobody had attached any importance to the presence of this camera.
      It hadn&rsquo;t even been opened and examined by the police, who had
      carefully noted everything else in the library. But as soon as the box was
      missed strange questions began to be asked and conjecturally answered. The
      police for the first time then observed that though it was half-past eight
      at night when the murder occurred, and the lamp was not lighted, the
      witnesses who burst first into the room described all they saw as if they
      had seen it clearly. They spoke of things as they would be seen in a very
      bright light, with absolute definiteness. This set up inquiry, and the
      result of the inquiry was to bring out the fact, which in the excitement
      of the moment had escaped the notice of all the servants, that as they
      entered the room and stared about at the murder, the electric flash of the
      apparatus was actually in operation. But the scene itself had diverted
      their attention from the minor matter of the light that showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector had been watching me narrowly as I read these extracts. When
      I reached that point, he broke in with a word of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that put me on the track, you see,&rdquo; he said, leaning
      forward once more. &ldquo;I thought to myself, if the light was acting,
      then the whole apparatus must necessarily have been at work, and the scene
      as it took place must have been photographed, act by act and step by step,
      exactly as it happened. At the time the murderer, whoever he was, can&rsquo;t
      have known the meaning of the flashes. But later, he must have come to
      learn in some way what the electric light meant, and must have realised,
      sooner than we did, that therein the box, in the form of six successive
      negatives of the stages in the crime, was the evidence that would
      infallibly convict him of this murder.&rdquo; He stroked his moustache
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;And to think, too,&rdquo; he went on with a somewhat
      sheepish air, &ldquo;we should have had those photographs there in our
      power all those days and nights, and have let them in the end slip like
      that through our fingers! To think he should have found it out sooner than
      we! To think that an amateur like the murderer should have outwitted us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you know,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;there was ever more
      than one photograph? How do you know this wasn&rsquo;t the only negative?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; the Inspector answered quickly, pointing to a
      figure in the corner of the proof, &ldquo;do you see that six? Well, that
      tells the tale. Each plate of the series was numbered so in the apparatus.
      Number six could only fall into focus after numbers one, and two, and
      three, and four, and five, had first been photographed. We&rsquo;ve only
      got the last&mdash;and least useful for our purpose. There must have been
      five earlier ones, showing every stage of the crime, if only we&rsquo;d
      known it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was worked up now to a strange pitch of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did this one come into your possession?&rdquo; I asked, all
      breathless. &ldquo;If you managed to lay your hands on one, why not on all
      six of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the trouble!&rdquo; he replied, still gazing at me
      hard. &ldquo;You see, it was this way. As soon as we found the camera was
      missing, we came to the conclusion the murderer must have returned to The
      Grange to fetch it. But it was a large and heavy box, and the only one of
      its kind as yet manufactured; so, to carry it away in his hands would no
      doubt have led to instant detection. I concluded, therefore, the man would
      take off the box entire, so as to prevent the danger of removing the
      plates on the spot; and as soon as he reached a place of safety in the
      shrubbery, he&rsquo;d fling away the camera, either destroying the
      incriminating negatives then and there or carrying them off with him. The
      details of the invention had already been explained to me by your father&rsquo;s
      instrument-maker, who set up the clockwork for him from his own designs;
      and I knew that the removal of the plates from the box was a delicate, and
      to some extent a difficult, operation. So I felt sure they could only have
      been taken out in a place of comparative safety, not far from the house;
      and I searched the shrubbery carefully, to find the camera.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found it at last?&rdquo; I asked, unable to restrain my
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it at last,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;near the far end of
      the grounds, just flung into the deep grass, behind a clump of lilacs. The
      camera was there intact, but five plates were missing. The sixth, from
      which the positive you hold in your hand was taken, had got jammed in the
      mechanism in the effort to remove it. Evidently the murderer had tried to
      take out the plates in a very great hurry and with trembling hands, as was
      not unnatural. He had succeeded with five, when the sixth stuck fast in
      the groove of the clockwork. Just at that moment, as we judged, either an
      alarm was raised in the rear, or some panic fear seized on him. Probably
      the fellow judged right that the most incriminating pictures of all had by
      that time been removed, and that the last would only show his back, if it
      included him at all, or if he came into focus. Perhaps he had even been
      able unconsciously to count the flashes at the moment, and knew that
      before the sixth flash arrived he was on the ledge of the window. At any
      rate, he clearly gave up the attempt to remove the sixth, and flung the
      whole apparatus away from him in a sudden access of horror. We guessed as
      much both from the appearance of the spot where the grass was trampled
      down, and the way the angle of the camera was imbedded forcibly in the
      soft ground of the shrubbery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he got away with the rest!&rdquo; I exclaimed, following it up
      like a story, but a story in which I was myself an unconscious character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; the Inspector answered, stroking his chin
      regretfully. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s most annoying of all, we&rsquo;ve
      every reason to suppose the fellow stole the things only a few minutes
      before we actually missed them. For we saw grounds for supposing he jumped
      away from the spot, and climbed over the wall at the back, cutting his
      hands as he went with the bottle-glass on the top to prevent intruders.
      And what makes us think only a very short time must have elapsed between
      the removal of the plates and the moment we came upon his tracks is this&mdash;the
      blood from his cut hands was still fresh and wet upon the wall when we
      found it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you only just missed him!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;He got
      off by the skin of his teeth. It&rsquo;s wonderful, when you were so near,
      you shouldn&rsquo;t have managed to overtake him! One would have thought
      you must have been able to track him to earth somehow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would have thought so,&rdquo; the Inspector answered, rather
      crestfallen. &ldquo;But policemen, after all, are human like the rest of
      us. We missed the one chance that might have led to an arrest. And now,
      what I want to ask you once more is this: Reflecting over what you&rsquo;ve
      heard and read to-day, do you think you can recollect&mdash;a very small
      matter&mdash;whether or not there were SEVERAL distinct flashes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I shut my eyes once more, and looked hard into the past. Slowly, as I
      looked, a sort of dream seemed to come over me. I saw it vaguely now, or
      thought I saw it. Flash, flash, flash, flash. Then the sound of the
      pistol. Then the Picture, and the Horror, and the awful blank. I opened my
      eyes again, and told the Inspector so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And once more,&rdquo; he went on, in a very insinuating voice.
      &ldquo;Shut your eyes again, and look back upon that day. Can&rsquo;t you
      remember whether or not, just a moment before, you saw the murderer&rsquo;s
      face by the light of the flashes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I shut my eyes and thought. Again the flashes seemed to stand out clear
      and distinct. But no detail supervened&mdash;no face came back to me. I
      felt it was useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I said shortly. &ldquo;It only makes my head
      swim. I can remember no further.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; the Inspector answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as Dr.
      Wade said. Suggest a fact in your past history, and you may possibly
      remember it; but ask you to recall anything not suggested or already
      known, and all seems a mere blank to you! You haven&rsquo;t the faintest
      idea, then, who the murderer was or what he looked like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose up before him solemnly, and stared him full in the face. I was
      wrought up by that time to a perfect pitch of excitement and interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea,&rdquo; I answered, feeling
      myself a woman at last, and realising my freedom; &ldquo;I know and
      remember no more of it than you do. But from this moment forth, I shall
      not rest until I&rsquo;ve found him out and tracked him down, and punished
      him. I shall never let my head rest in peace on my pillow until I&rsquo;ve
      discovered my father&rsquo;s murderer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; the Inspector said sharply, shutting his
      notes up to go. &ldquo;If you persevere in that mind, and do as you say,
      we shall soon get to the bottom of the Woodbury Mystery!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And even as he spoke a key turned in the front door. I knew it was Aunt
      Emma, come in from her marketing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; I BECOME A WOMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma burst into the room, all horror and astonishment. She looked at
      the Inspector for a few seconds in breathless indignation; then she broke
      out in a tone of fiery remonstrance which fairly surprised me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by this intrusion, sir? How dare you force your
      way into my house in my absence? How dare you encourage my servants to
      disobey my orders? How dare you imperil this young lady&rsquo;s health by
      coming here to talk with her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned round to me anxiously. I suppose I was very flushed with
      excitement and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling child,&rdquo; she cried, growing pale all at once,
      &ldquo;Maria should never have allowed him to come inside the door! You
      should have stopped upstairs! You should have refused to see him! I shall
      have you ill again on my hands, as before, after this. He&rsquo;ll have
      undone all the good the last four years have done for you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was another woman now. I felt it in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie dearest,&rdquo; I answered, moving across to her, and laying
      my hand on her shoulder to soothe her poor ruffled nerves, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      be the least alarmed. It&rsquo;s I who&rsquo;m to blame, and not Maria. I
      told her to let this gentleman in. He&rsquo;s done me good, not harm. I&rsquo;m
      so glad to have been allowed at last to speak freely about it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma shook all over, visibly to the naked eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a relapse, my child!&rdquo; she exclaimed, half
      crying, and clinging to me in her terror. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll forget all
      you&rsquo;ve learned: you&rsquo;ll go back these four years again!&mdash;Leave
      my house at once, sir! You should never have entered it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood between them like a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, stop here a little longer,&rdquo; I said, waving my hand
      towards him imperiously. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet heard all it&rsquo;s
      right for me to hear.... Auntie, you mistake. I&rsquo;m a woman at last. I
      see what everything means. I&rsquo;m beginning to remember again. For four
      years that hateful Picture has haunted me night and day. I could never
      shut my eyes for a minute without seeing it. I&rsquo;ve longed to know
      what it all meant; but whenever I&rsquo;ve asked, I&rsquo;ve been
      repressed like a baby. I&rsquo;m a baby no longer: I feel myself a woman.
      What the Inspector here has told me already, half opens my eyes: I must
      have them opened altogether now. I can&rsquo;t stop at this point. I&rsquo;m
      going back to Woodbury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma clung to me still harder in a perfect agony of passionate
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Woodbury, my darling!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Going back! Oh,
      Una, it&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; the Inspector answered, with a very quiet
      smile. &ldquo;Miss Callingham has recovered, I venture to say, far more
      profoundly than you imagine. This repression, our medical adviser tells
      us, has been bad for her. If she&rsquo;s allowed to visit freely the
      places connected with her earlier life, it may all return again to her;
      and the ends of Justice may thus at last be served for us. I notice
      already one hopeful symptom: Miss Callingham speaks of going back to
      Woodbury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma looked up at him, horrified. All her firmness was gone now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s YOU who&rsquo;ve put this into her head!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, in a ferment of horror. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d never thought of it
      herself. You&rsquo;ve made her do it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, auntie,&rdquo; I answered, feeling my ground grow
      surer under me every moment as I spoke, &ldquo;this gentleman has never
      even by the merest hint suggested such an idea to my mind. It occurred to
      me quite spontaneously. I MUST find out now who was my father&rsquo;s
      murderer! All the Inspector has told me seems to arouse in my brain some
      vague, forgotten chords. It brings back to me faint shadows. I feel sure
      if I went to Woodbury I should remember much more. And then, you must see
      for yourself, there&rsquo;s another reason, dear, that ought to make me
      go. Nobody but I ever saw the murderer&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s a duty
      imposed upon me from without, as it were, never to rest again in peace
      till I&rsquo;ve recognised him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma collapsed into an easy-chair. Her face was deadly pale. Her
      ringers trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go, Una,&rdquo; she cried, playing nervously with her
      gloves, &ldquo;I must go with you too! I must take care of you: I must
      watch over you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I took her quivering hand in mine and stroked it gently. It was a soft and
      delicate white little hand, all marked inside with curious ragged scars
      that I&rsquo;d known and observed ever since I first knew her. I held it
      in silence for a minute. Somehow I felt our positions were reversed
      to-day. This interview had suddenly brought out what I know now to be my
      own natural and inherent character&mdash;self-reliant, active, abounding
      in initiative. For four years I had been as a child in her hands, through
      mere force of circumstances. My true self came out now and asserted its
      supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; I said, soothing her cheek; &ldquo;I shall go
      alone. I shall try what I can discover and remember myself without any
      suggestion or explanation from others. I want to find out how things
      really stand. I shall set to work on my own account to unravel this
      mystery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you manage things by yourself?&rdquo; Aunt Emma
      exclaimed, wringing her hands despondently. &ldquo;A girl of your age!
      without even a maid! and all alone in the world! I shall be afraid to let
      you go. Dr. Wade won&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew myself up very straight, and realised the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Emma,&rdquo; I said plainly, in a decided voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      a full-grown woman, over twenty-one years of age, mistress of my own acts,
      and no longer a ward of yours. I can do as I like, and neither Dr. Wade
      nor anybody else can prevent me. He may ADVICE me not to go: he has no
      power to ORDER me. I&rsquo;m my father&rsquo;s heiress, and a person of
      independent means. I&rsquo;ve been a cipher too long. From to-day I take
      my affairs wholly into my own hands. I &lsquo;ll go round at once and see
      your lawyer, your banker, your agent, your tradesmen, and tell them that
      henceforth I draw my own rents, I receive my own dividends, I pay my own
      bills, I keep my own banking account. And to-morrow or the next day I set
      out for Woodbury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector turned to Aunt Emma with a demonstrative smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see for yourself,&rdquo; he said, well pleased, &ldquo;what
      this interview has done for her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Emma only drew back, wrung her hands again in impotent despair,
      and stared at him blankly like a wounded creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector took up his hat to leave. I followed him out to the door,
      and shook hands with him cordially. The burden felt lighter on my
      shoulders already. For four long years that mystery had haunted me day and
      night, as a thing impenetrable, incomprehensible, not even to be inquired
      about. The mere sense that I might now begin to ask what it meant seemed
      to make it immediately less awful and less burdensome to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to the drawing-room, Aunt Emma sat there on the sofa,
      crying silently, the very picture of misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; she said, without even raising her eyes to mine,
      &ldquo;the man may have done as he says: he may have restored you your
      mind again; but what&rsquo;s that to me? He&rsquo;s lost me my child, my
      darling, my daughter!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stooped down and kissed her. Dear, tender-hearted auntie! she had always
      been very good to me. But I knew I was right, for all that, in becoming a
      woman,&mdash;in asserting my years, my independence, my freedom, my duty.
      To have shirked it any longer would have been sheer cowardice. So I just
      kissed her silently, and went up to my own room&mdash;to put on my brown
      hat, and go out to the banker&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment forth, one fierce desire in life alone possessed me. The
      brooding mystery that enveloped my life ceased to be passive, and became
      an active goad, as it were, to push me forward incessantly on my search
      for the runaway I was the creature of a fixed idea. A fiery energy spurred
      me on all my time. I was determined now to find out my father&rsquo;s
      murderer. I was determined to shake off the atmosphere of doubt and
      forgetfulness. I was determined to recall those first scenes of my life
      that so eluded my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, strange to say, it was rather a burning curiosity and a deep sense of
      duty that urged me on, than anything I could properly call affection&mdash;still
      less, revenge or malice. I didn&rsquo;t remember my father as alive at
      all: the one thing I could recollect about him was the ghastly look of
      that dead body, stretched at full length on the library floor, with its
      white beard all dabbled in the red blood that clotted it. It was abstract
      zeal for the discovery of the truth that alone pushed me on. This search
      became to me henceforth an end and aim in itself. It stood out, as it
      were, visibly in the imperative mood: &ldquo;go here;&rdquo; &ldquo;go
      there;&rdquo; &ldquo;do this;&rdquo; &ldquo;try that;&rdquo; &ldquo;leave
      no stone unturned anywhere till you&rsquo;ve tracked down the murderer!&rdquo;
      Those were the voices that now incessantly though inaudibly pursued me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I spent in preparations for my departure. I would hunt up
      Woodbury now, though fifty Aunt Emma&rsquo;s held their gentle old faces
      up in solemn warning against me. The day after that again, I set out on my
      task. The pull was hard. I had taken my own affairs entirely into my own
      hands by that time, and had provided myself with money for a long stay at
      Woodbury. But it was the very first railway journey I could ever remember
      to have made alone; and I confess, when I found myself seated all by
      myself in a first-class carriage, with no friend beside me, my resolution
      for a moment almost broke down again. It was so terrible to feel oneself
      boxed up there for an hour or two alone, with that awful Picture staring
      one in the face all the time from every fence and field and wall and
      hoarding. It obliterated Fry&rsquo;s Cocoa; it fixed itself on the yellow
      face of Colman&rsquo;s Mustard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went by Liverpool Street, and drove across to Paddington. I had never,
      to my knowledge, been in London before: and it was all so new to me. But
      Liverpool Street was even newer to me than Paddington, I noticed. A faint
      sense of familiarity seemed to hang about the Great Western line. And that
      was not surprising, I thought, as I turned it over; for, of course, in the
      old days, when we lived at Woodbury, I must often have come down from town
      that way with my father. Yet I remembered nothing of it all definitely;
      the most I could say was that I seemed dimly to recollect having been
      there before&mdash;though when or where or how, I hadn&rsquo;t the
      faintest notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was early at Paddington. The refreshment room somehow failed to attract
      me. I walked up and down the platform, waiting for my train. As I did so,
      a boy pasted a poster on a board: it was the contents-sheet of one of the
      baser little Society papers. Something strange in it caught my eye. I
      looked again in amazement. Oh, great heavens! what was this in big flaring
      letters?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MISS UNA CALLINGHAM AND THE WOODBURY MYSTERY! Is SHE SCREENING THE
      MURDERER? A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words took my breath away. They were too horrible to realise. I
      positively couldn&rsquo;t speak. I went up to the bookstall, laid down my
      penny without moving my lips, and took the paper in my hand in tremulous
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dared not open it there and then, I confess. I waited till I was in the
      train, and on my way to Woodbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I did so, it was worse, even worse than my fears. The article was
      short, but it was very hateful. It said nothing straight out&mdash;the
      writer had evidently the fear of the law of libel before his eyes as he
      wrote,&mdash;but it hinted and insinuated in a detestable undertone the
      most vile innuendoes. A Treasury Doctor and a Police Inspector, it said,
      had lately examined Miss Callingham again, and found her intellect in
      every respect perfectly normal, except that she couldn&rsquo;t remember
      the face of her father&rsquo;s murderer. Now, this was odd, because, you
      see, Miss Callingham was in the room at the moment the shot was fired;
      and, alone in the world, Miss Callingham had seen the face of the man who
      fired it. Who was that man? and why was he there, unknown to the servants,
      in a room with nobody but Mr. Callingham and his daughter? A correspondent
      (who preferred to guard his incognito) had suggested in this matter some
      very searching questions: Could the young man&mdash;for it was allowed he
      was young&mdash;have been there with Miss Callingham when Mr. Callingham
      entered? Could he have been on terms of close intimacy with the heroine of
      The Grange Mystery, who was a young lady&mdash;as all the world knew from
      her photographs&mdash;of great personal attractiveness, and who was also
      the heiress to a considerable property? Could he have been there, then, by
      appointment, without the father&rsquo;s knowledge? Was this the common
      case of a clandestine assignation? Could the father have returned to the
      house unexpectedly, at an inopportune moment, and found his daughter
      there, closeted with a stranger&mdash;perhaps with a man who had already,
      for sufficient grounds, been forbidden the premises? Such things might be,
      in this world that we live in: he would be a bold man who would deny them
      categorically. Could an altercation have arisen on the father&rsquo;s
      return, and the fatal shot have been fired in the ensuing scuffle? And
      could the young lady then have feigned this curious relapse into that
      Second State we had all heard so much about, for no other reason than to
      avoid giving evidence at a trial for murder against her guilty lover?
    </p>
    <p>
      These were suggestions that deserved the closest consideration of the
      Authorities charged with the repression of crime. Was it not high time
      that the inquest on Mr. Callingham&rsquo;s body should be formally
      reopened, and that the young lady, now restored (as we gathered) to her
      own seven senses, should be closely interrogated by trained legal
      cross-examiners?
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid down the paper with a burning face. I learned now, for the first
      time, how closely my case had been watched, how eagerly my every act and
      word had been canvassed. It was hateful to think of my photograph having
      been exposed in every London shop-window, and of anonymous slanderers
      being permitted to indite such scandal as this about an innocent woman.
      But, at any rate, it had the effect of sealing my fate. If I meant even
      before to probe this mystery to the bottom, I felt now no other course was
      possibly open to me. For the sake of my own credit, for the sake of my own
      good fame, I must find out and punish my father&rsquo;s murderer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; RELIVING MY LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Often, as you walk down a street, a man or woman passes you by. You look
      up at them and say to yourself, &ldquo;I seem to know that face&rdquo;;
      but you can put no name to it, attach to it no definite idea, no
      associations of any sort. That was just how Woodbury struck me when I
      first came back to it. The houses, the streets, the people, were in a way
      familiar; yet I could no more have found my way alone from the station to
      The Grange than I could find my way alone from here to Kamschatka.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I drove up first in search of lodgings. At the station even several
      people had bowed or shaken hands with me respectfully as I descended from
      the train. They came up as if they thought I must recognise them at once:
      there was recognition in their eyes; but when they met my blank stare,
      they seemed to remember all about it, and merely murmured in strange
      tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, miss! So you&rsquo;re here: glad to see you&rsquo;ve
      come back again at last to Woodbury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This reception dazzled me. It was so strange, so uncanny. I was glad to
      get away in a fly by myself, and to be driven to lodgings in the clean
      little High Street. For to me, it wasn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;coming back&rdquo;
      at all: it was coming to a strange town, where everyone knew me, and <i>I</i>
      knew nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to go to Jane&rsquo;s, of course,&rdquo; the
      driver said to me with a friendly nod as he reached the High Street: and
      not liking to confess my forgetfulness of Jane, I responded with warmth
      that Jane&rsquo;s would, no doubt, exactly suit me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drew up at the door of a neat little house. The driver rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Una&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he said, confidentially; &ldquo;and
      she&rsquo;s looking for lodgings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was inexpressibly strange and weird to me, this one-sided recognition,
      this unfamiliar familiarity: it gave me a queer thrill of the supernatural
      that I can hardly express to you. But I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, when
      a kindly-faced, middle-aged English upper-class servant rushed out at me,
      open-armed, and hugging me hard to her breast, exclaimed with many loud
      kisses:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Una, Miss Una! So it&rsquo;s YOU, dear; so it is! Then you&rsquo;ve
      come back at last to us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could hardly imagine what to say or do. The utmost I could assert with
      truth was, Jane&rsquo;s face wasn&rsquo;t exactly and entirely in all ways
      unfamiliar to me. Yet I could see Jane herself was so unfeignedly
      delighted to see me again, that I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to confess I&rsquo;d
      forgotten her very existence. So I took her two hands in mine&mdash;since
      friendliness begets friendliness&mdash;and holding her off a little way,
      for fear the kisses should be repeated, I said to her very gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Jane, since those days I&rsquo;ve had a terrible shock,
      and you can hardly expect me to remember anything. It&rsquo;s all like a
      dream to me. You must forgive me if I don&rsquo;t recall it just at once
      as I ought to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, miss,&rdquo; Jane answered, holding my hands in her
      delight and weeping volubly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve read about all that, of
      course, in the London newspapers. But there, I&rsquo;m glad anyhow you
      remembered to come and look for my lodgings. I think I should just have
      sat down and cried if they told me Miss Una&rsquo;d come back to Woodbury,
      and never so much as asked to see me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t think I ever felt so like a hypocrite in my life before. But
      I realised at least that even if Jane&rsquo;s lodgings were discomfort
      embodied, I must take them and stop in them, while I remained there, now.
      Nothing else was possible. I COULDN&rsquo;T go elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, however, the rooms turned out to be as neat as a new pin, and
      as admirably kept as any woman in England could keep them. I gathered from
      the very first, of course, that Jane had been one of the servants at The
      Grange in the days of my First State; and while I drank my cup of tea,
      Jane herself came in and talked volubly to me, disclosing to me,
      parenthetically, the further fact that she was the parlour-maid at the
      time of my father&rsquo;s murder. That gave me a clue to her identity.
      Then she was the witness Greenfield who gave evidence at the inquest! I
      made a mental note of that, and determined to look up what she&rsquo;d
      said to the coroner, in the book of extracts the Inspector gave me, as
      soon as I got alone in my bedroom that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, however, Jane came in again, with the freedom of an old
      servant, and talked to me much about the Woodbury Mystery. Gradually, as
      time went on that night, though I remembered nothing definite of myself
      about her, the sense of familiarity and friendliness came home to me more
      vividly. The appropriate emotion seemed easier to rouse, I observed, than
      the intellectual memory. I knew Jane and I had been on very good terms,
      some time, somewhere. I talked with her easily, for I had a consciousness
      of companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, without revealing to her how little I could recollect about her
      own personality, I confessed to Jane, by slow degrees, that the whole past
      was still gone utterly from my shattered memory. I told her I knew nothing
      except the Picture and the facts it comprised; and to show her just how
      small that knowledge really was, I showed her (imprudently enough) the
      photograph the Inspector had left with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane looked at it long and slowly, with tears in her eyes. Then she said
      at last, after a deep pause, in a very hushed voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how did you get this? It wasn&rsquo;t put in the papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered quietly, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t put in the
      papers. For reasons of their own, the police kept it unpublished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane gazed at the proof still closer. &ldquo;They oughtn&rsquo;t to have
      done that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to have sent it out everywhere broadcast&mdash;so that
      anybody who knew the man could tell him by his back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to me such obvious good sense that I wondered to myself the
      police hadn&rsquo;t thought long since of it; but I supposed they had some
      good ground of their own for holding it all this time in their own
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane went on talking to me still for many minutes about the scene:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; that was just how he lay, poor dear gentleman! And the
      book on the chair, too! Well, did you ever in your life see anything so
      like! And to think it was taken all by itself, as one might say, by magic.
      But there! your poor papa was a wonderful clever man. Such things as he
      used to invent! Such ideas and such machines! We were sorry for him,
      though we always thought, to be sure, he was dreadful severe with you,
      Miss Una. Such a gentleman to have his own way, too&mdash;so cold and
      reserved like. But one mustn&rsquo;t talk nothing but good about the dead,
      they say. And if he was a bit hard, he was more than hard treated for it
      in the end, poor gentleman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It interested me to get these half side-lights on my father&rsquo;s
      character. Knowing nothing of him, as I did, save the solitary fact that
      he was the white-haired gentleman I saw dead in my Picture, I naturally
      wanted to learn as much as I could from this old servant of ours as to the
      family conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you thought him harsh, in the servants&rsquo;-hall?&rdquo; I
      said tentatively to Jane. &ldquo;You thought him hard and unbending?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there, Miss,&rdquo; Jane ran on, putting a cushion to my back
      tenderly&mdash;it was strange to be the recipient of so much delicate
      attention from a perfect stranger,&mdash;&ldquo;not exactly what you&rsquo;d
      call harsh to us ourselves, you know: he was a good master enough, as long
      as one did what was ordered, though he was a little bit fidgetty. But to
      you, we all thought he was always rather hard. People said so in Woodbury.
      And yet, in a way, I don&rsquo;t know how it was, he always seemed more&rsquo;n
      half afraid of you. He was careful about your health, and spoiled and
      petted you for that; yet he was always pulling you up, you know, and
      looking after what you did: and for one thing, I remember, there&rsquo;s
      many a time you were sent to bed when you were a good big girl for nothing
      on earth else but because he heard you talking to us in the hall about
      Australia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking to you about Australia!&rdquo; I cried, pricking my ears.
      &ldquo;Why, what harm was there in that? Why on earth didn&rsquo;t he want
      me to talk about Australia?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what harm indeed?&rdquo; Jane echoed blandly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      what we often used to say among ourselves downstairs. But Mr. Callingham,
      he was always that way, miss&mdash;so strict and particular. He said he&rsquo;d
      forbidden you to say a word to anybody about that confounded country; and
      you must do as you were told. He seemed to have a grudge against
      Australia, though it was there he made his money. And he always would have
      his own way, your father would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke, I looked hard at the white head in the photograph. Even
      as I did so, a thought occurred to me that had never occurred before. Both
      in my mental Picture, and in looking at the photograph when I saw it
      first, the feeling that was uppermost in my mind was not sorrow, but
      horror. I didn&rsquo;t think with affection and regret and a deep sense of
      bereavement about my father&rsquo;s murder. The emotional accompaniment
      that had stamped itself upon the very fibre of my soul, was not pain but
      awe. I think my main feeling was a feeling that a foul crime had taken
      place in the house, not a feeling that I had lost a very dear and near
      relative. Rightly or wrongly, I drew from this the inference, which Jane&rsquo;s
      gossip confirmed, that I had probably rather feared than loved my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange to be reduced to such indirect evidence on such a point as
      that; but it was all I could get, and I had to be content with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane, leaning over my shoulder, looked hard at the photograph too. I could
      see her eyes were fixed on the back of the man who was seen disappearing
      through the open window. He was dressed like a gentleman, in
      knickerbockers and jacket, as far as one could judge; for the evening
      light rather blurred that part of the picture. One hand was just waved,
      palm open, behind him. Jane regarded it hard. Then she gave an odd little
      start:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, just look at that hand!&rdquo; she cried, with a tremor of
      surprise. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what it is? Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s
      a woman&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed back at her incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; I answered, shaking my head. &ldquo;It belongs
      as clear as day to the man you see in the photograph. How on earth could
      his hand be a woman&rsquo;s then, I&rsquo;d like to know? I can see the
      shirt-cuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Jane answered, with simple common-sense: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      DRESSED like a man, of course, and it&rsquo;s a man to look at; but the
      hand&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s, as true as I&rsquo;m standing here. Why
      mightn&rsquo;t a woman dress in a man&rsquo;s suit on purpose? And perhaps
      it was just because they were so sure it was a man as did it, that the
      police has gone wrong so long in trying to find the murderer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked hard at the hand myself. Then I shut my eyes, and thought of the
      corresponding object in my mental Picture. The result fairly staggered me.
      The impression in each case was exactly the same. It was a soft and
      delicate hand, very white and womanlike. But was it really a woman&rsquo;s?
      I couldn&rsquo;t feel quite sure in my own mind about that; but the very
      warning Jane gave me seemed to me a most useful one. It would be well,
      after all, to keep one&rsquo;s mind sedulously open to every possible
      explanation, and to take nothing for granted as to the murderer&rsquo;s
      personality.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE GRANGE AT WOODBURY
    </h2>
    <p>
      I stopped for three weeks in Jane&rsquo;s lodgings; and before the end of
      that time, Jane and I had got upon the most intimate footing. It was
      partly her kindliness that endeared her to me, and her constant sense of
      continuity with the earlier days which I had quite forgotten; but it was
      partly too, I felt sure, a vague revival within my own breast of a
      familiarity that had long ago subsisted between us. I was coming to myself
      again, on one side of my nature. Day by day I grew more certain that while
      facts had passed away from me, appropriate emotions remained vaguely
      present. Among the Woodbury people that I met, I recognised none to say
      that I knew them; but I knew almost at first sight that I liked this one
      and disliked that one. And in every case alike, when I talked the matter
      over afterwards with Jane, she confirmed my suspicion that in my First
      State I had liked or disliked just those persons respectively. My brain
      was upset, but my heart remained precisely the same as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my second morning I went up to The Grange with her. The house was still
      unlet. Since the day of the murder, nobody cared to live in it. The garden
      and shrubbery had been sadly neglected: Jane took me out of the way as we
      walked up the path, to show me the place where the photographic apparatus
      had been found embedded in the grass, and where the murderer had cut his
      hands getting over the wall in his frantic agitation. The wall was pretty
      high and protected with bottle-glass. I guessed he must have been tall to
      scramble over it. That seemed to tell against Jane&rsquo;s crude idea that
      a woman might have done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I said so to Jane, she met me at once with the crushing reply:
      &ldquo;Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t the same person that came back for the box.&rdquo;
      I saw she was right again. I had jumped at a conclusion. In cases like
      this, one must leave no hypothesis untried, jump at no conclusions of any
      sort. Clearly, that woman ought to have been made a detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I entered the house the weird sense of familiarity that pursued me
      throughout rose to a very high pitch. I couldn&rsquo;t fairly say, indeed,
      that I remembered the different rooms. All I could say with certainty was
      that I had seen them before. To this there were three exceptions&mdash;the
      three that belonged to my Second State&mdash;the library, my bedroom, and
      the hall and staircase. The first was indelibly printed on my memory as a
      component part of the Picture, and I found my recollection of every object
      in the room almost startling in its correctness. Only, there was an alcove
      on one side that I&rsquo;d quite forgotten, and I saw why most clearly. I
      stood with my back to it as I looked at the Picture. The other two bits I
      remembered as the room in which I had had my first great illness, and the
      passage down which I had been carried or helped when I was taken to Aunt
      Emma&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had begun to recognise now that the emotional impression made upon me by
      people and things was the only sure guide I still possessed as to their
      connection or association with my past history. And the rooms at The
      Grange had each in this way some distinctive characteristic. The library,
      of course, was the chief home of the Horror which had hung upon my spirit
      even during the days when I hardly knew in any intelligible sense the
      cause of it. But the drawing-room and dining-room both produced upon my
      mind a vague consciousness of constraint. I was dimly aware of being ill
      at ease and uncomfortable in them. My own bedroom, on the contrary, gave
      me a pleasant feeling of rest and freedom and security: while the servants&rsquo;-hall
      and the kitchen seemed perfect paradises of liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! many&rsquo;s the time, miss,&rdquo; Jane said with a sigh,
      looking over at the empty grate, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d come down here to make
      cakes or puddings, and laugh and joke like a child with Mary an&rsquo; me.
      I often used to say to Emily&mdash;her as was cook here before Ellen
      Smith,&mdash;&lsquo;Miss Una&rsquo;s never so happy as when she&rsquo;s
      down here in the kitchen.&rsquo; And &lsquo;That&rsquo;s true what you
      say,&rsquo; says Emily to me, many a time and often.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was exactly the impression left upon my own mind. I began to
      conclude, in a dim, formless way, that my father must have been a somewhat
      stern and unsympathetic man; that I had felt constrained and uncomfortable
      in his presence upstairs, and had often been pleased to get away from his
      eye to the comparative liberty and ease of my own room or of the
      maid-servants&rsquo; quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in the big attic that had once been the nursery, I paused and
      looked at Jane. A queer sensation came over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; I said slowly, hardly liking to frame the words,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something strange about this room. He wasn&rsquo;t
      cruel to me, was he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, miss,&rdquo; Jane answered promptly. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t
      never what you might call exactly cruel. He was a very good father, and
      looked after you well; but he was sort of stern and moody-like&mdash;would
      have his own way, and didn&rsquo;t pay no attention to fads and fancies,
      he called &lsquo;em. When you were little, many&rsquo;s the time he sent
      you up here for punishment&mdash;disobedience and such like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I took out the photograph and tried, as it were, to think of my father as
      alive and with his eyes open. I couldn&rsquo;t remember the eyes. Jane
      told me they were blue; but I think what she said was the sort of
      impression the face produced upon me. A man not unjust or harsh in his
      dealings with myself, but very strong and masterful. A man who would have
      his own way in spite of anybody. A father who ruled his daughter as a
      vessel of his making, to be done as he would with, and be moulded to his
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, my visit to The Grange resulted in the end in casting very little
      light upon the problem before me. It pained and distressed me greatly, but
      it brought no new elements of the case into view: at best, it only
      familiarised me with the scene of action of the tragedy. The presence of
      the alcove was the one fresh feature. Nothing recalled to me as yet in any
      way the murderer&rsquo;s features. I racked my brain in vain; no fresh
      image came up in it. I could recollect nothing about the man or his
      antecedents.
    </p>
    <p>
      I almost began to doubt that I would ever succeed in reconstructing my
      past, when even the sight of the home in which I had spent my childish
      days suggested so few new thoughts or ideas to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a day or two after that I rested at Jane&rsquo;s, lest I should
      disturb my brain too much. Then I called once more on the doctor who had
      made the post mortem on my father, and given evidence at the inquest, to
      see if anything he could say might recall my lapsed memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he came into the room&mdash;a man about fifty, close-shaven and
      kindly-looking&mdash;I recognised him at once, and held out my hand to him
      frankly. He surveyed me from head to foot with a good medical stare, and
      then wrung my hand in return with extraordinary warmth and effusion. I
      could see at once he retained a most pleasing recollection of my First
      State, and was really glad to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you remember me then, Una!&rdquo; he cried, with quite
      fatherly delight. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgotten me, my dear, as you&rsquo;ve
      forgotten all the rest, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was startling to be called by one&rsquo;s Christian name like that, and
      by a complete stranger, too; but I was getting quite accustomed now to
      these little incongruities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I remember you perfectly,&rdquo; I answered, half-grieved
      to distress him, &ldquo;though I shouldn&rsquo;t have known your name, and
      didn&rsquo;t expect to see you. You&rsquo;re the doctor who attended me in
      my first great illness&mdash;the illness with which my present life began&mdash;just
      after the murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back, a little crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s all you recollect, is it?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me before, dear? Not Dr. Marten, who used
      to take you on his knee when you were a tiny little girl, and bring you
      lollipops from town, to the great detriment of your digestion, and get
      into rows with your poor father for indulging you and spoiling you? You
      must surely remember me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head slowly. I was sorry to disappoint him; but it was
      necessary before all things to get at the bare truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Do please forgive
      me! You must have read in the papers, like everybody else, of the very
      great change that has so long come over me. Bear in mind, I can&rsquo;t
      remember anything at all that occurred before the murder. That first
      illness is to me the earliest recollection of childhood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed across at me compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, like a very
      affectionate friend, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s much better so. You have been
      mercifully spared a great deal of pain. Una, when I first saw you at The
      Grange after your father&rsquo;s death, I thanked heaven you had been so
      seized. I thanked heaven the world had become suddenly a blank to you. I
      prayed hard you might never recover your senses again, or at least your
      memory. And now that you&rsquo;re slowly returned to life once more,
      against all hope or fear, I&rsquo;m heartily glad it&rsquo;s in this
      peculiar way. I&rsquo;m heartily glad all the past&rsquo;s blotted out for
      you. You can&rsquo;t understand that, my child? Ah, no, very likely not.
      But I think it&rsquo;s much best for you, all your first life should be
      wholly forgotten.&rdquo; He paused for a second. Then he added slowly:
      &ldquo;If you remembered it all, the sense of the tragedy would be far
      more acute and poignant even than at present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; I said resolutely; &ldquo;but not the sense of
      mystery. It&rsquo;s THAT that appals me so! I&rsquo;d rather know the
      truth than be so wrapped up in the incomprehensible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me pityingly once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; he said, in the same gentle and fatherly
      voice, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t wholly understand. It doesn&rsquo;t all come
      home to you. I can see clearly, from what Inspector Wolferstan told me,
      after his visit to you the other day&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I broke in, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inspector Wolferstan!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Then he came down here
      to see you, did he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was horrible to find how all my movements were discussed and
      chronicled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he came down here to see me and talk things over,&rdquo; Dr.
      Marten went on, as calmly as if it were mere matter of course. &ldquo;And
      I could see from what he said you were still spared much. For instance,
      you remember it all only as an event that happened to an old man with a
      long white beard. You don&rsquo;t fully realise, except intellectually,
      that it was your own father. You&rsquo;re saved, as a daughter, the misery
      and horror of thinking and feeling it was your father who lay dead there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I admit that I
      can&rsquo;t feel it all as deeply as I ought. But none the less, I&rsquo;ve
      come down here to make a violent effort. Let it cost what it may, I must
      get at the truth. I wanted to see whether the sight of The Grange and of
      Woodbury may help me to recall the lost scenes in my memory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To my immense surprise, Dr. Marten rose from his seat, and standing up
      before me in a perfect agony of what seemed like terror, half mixed with
      affection, exclaimed in a very earnest and resolute voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Una, my child, whatever you do&mdash;I beg of you&mdash;I
      implore you&mdash;don&rsquo;t try to recall the past at all! Don&rsquo;t
      attempt it! Don&rsquo;t dream of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I cried, astonished. &ldquo;Surely it&rsquo;s my
      duty to try and find out my father&rsquo;s murderer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering me, he looked about him for half a minute in
      suspense, as if doubtful what next to do or to say. Then he walked across
      with great deliberation to the door of the room, and locked and
      double-locked it with furtive alarm, as I interpreted his action.
    </p>
    <p>
      So terrified did he seem, indeed, that for a moment the idea occurred to
      me in a very vague way&mdash;Was I talking with the murderer? Had the man
      who himself committed the crime conducted the post mortem, and put Justice
      off the scent? And was I now practically at the mercy of the criminal I
      was trying to track down? The thought for a second or two made me feel
      terribly uncomfortable. But I glanced at his back and at his hands, and
      reassured myself. That broad, short man was not the slim figure of my
      Picture and of the photograph. Those large red hands were not the
      originals of the small and delicate white palm just displayed at the back
      in both those strange documents of the mysterious murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came over again, and drew his chair close to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, my child,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I love you very much,
      as if you were my own daughter. I always loved you and admired you, and
      was sorry&mdash;oh, so sorry!&mdash;for you. You&rsquo;ve quite forgotten
      who I am; but I&rsquo;ve not forgotten you. Take what I say as coming from
      an old friend, from one who loves you and has your interest at heart. For
      heaven&rsquo;s sake, I implore you, my child, make no more inquiries. Try
      to forget&mdash;not to remember. If you do recollect, you&rsquo;ll be
      sorry in the end for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; I asked, amazed, yet somehow feeling in my heart I
      could trust him implicitly. &ldquo;Why should the knowledge of the true
      circumstances of the case make me more unhappy than I am at present?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed harder at me than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he replied in slow tones, weighing each word as he
      spoke, &ldquo;you may find that the murder was committed by some person or
      persons you love or once loved very much indeed. You may find it will rend
      your very heart-strings to see that person or those persons punished. You
      may find the circumstances were wholly otherwise than you imagine them to
      be.... Let sleeping dogs lie, my dear. Without your aid, nothing more can
      be done. Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to put the blood-hounds on the track
      of some unhappy creature who might otherwise escape. Don&rsquo;t rake it
      all up afresh. Bury it&mdash;bury it&mdash;bury it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so earnestly that he filled me with vague alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Marten,&rdquo; I said solemnly, &ldquo;answer me just one
      question. Do you know who was the murderer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he exclaimed, starting once more. &ldquo;Thank
      heaven, I can&rsquo;t tell you that! I don&rsquo;t know. I know nothing.
      Nobody on earth knows but the two who were present on the night of the
      murder, I feel sure. And of those two, one&rsquo;s unknown, and the other
      has forgotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you suspect who he is?&rdquo; I put in, probing the secret
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He trembled visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect who he is,&rdquo; he replied, after a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation. &ldquo;But I have never communicated, and will never
      communicate, my suspicions to anybody, not even to you. I will only say
      this: the person whom I suspect is one with whom you may now have
      forgotten all your past relations, but whom you would be sorry to punish
      if you recovered your memory. I formed a strong opinion at the time who
      that person was. I formed it from the nature and disposition of the wound,
      and the arrangement of the objects in the room when I was called in to see
      your father&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never said so at the inquest!&rdquo; I cried, indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me hard again. Then he spoke in a very slow and earnest
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your sake, Una, and for the sake of your affections, I held my
      peace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My dear, the suspicion was but a very
      slender one: I had nothing to go upon. And why should I have tried to
      destroy your happiness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That horrible article in the penny Society paper came back to my mind once
      more with hideous suggestiveness. I turned to him almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as you know, Dr. Marten,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;was I ever
      in love? Had I ever an admirer? Was I ever engaged to anyone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and smiled a sort of smile of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Admirers?&mdash;yes,
      dozens of them; I was one myself. Lovers?&mdash;who can say? But I advise
      you not to push the inquiry further.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I questioned him some minutes longer, but could get nothing more from him.
      Then I rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Marten,&rdquo; I said firmly, &ldquo;if I remember all, and if
      it wrings my heart to remember, I tell you I will give up that man to
      justice all the same! I think I know myself well enough to know this much
      at least, that I never, never could stoop either to love or to screen a
      man who could commit such a foul and dastardly crime as this one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took my hand fervently, raised it with warmth to his lips and kissed it
      twice over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, with tears dropping down his gentle old
      cheeks, &ldquo;this is a very great mystery&mdash;a terrible mystery. But
      I know you speak the truth. I can see you mean it. Therefore, all the more
      earnestly do I beg and beseech you, go away from Woodbury at once, and as
      long as you live think no more about it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; A VISION OF DEAD YEARS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The interview with Dr. Marten left me very much disquieted. But it wasn&rsquo;t
      the only disquieting thing that occurred at Woodbury. Before I left the
      place I happened to go one day into Jane&rsquo;s own little sitting-room.
      Jane was anxious I should see it&mdash;she wanted me to know all her
      house, she said, for the sake of old times: and for the sake of those old
      times that I couldn&rsquo;t remember, but when I knew she&rsquo;d been
      kind to me, I went in and looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing very peculiar about Jane&rsquo;s little sitting-room:
      just the ordinary English landlady&rsquo;s parlour. You know the type:&mdash;square
      table in the middle; bright blue vases on the mantelpiece;
      chromo-lithograph from the Illustrated London News on the wall; rickety
      whatnot with glass-shaded wax-flowers in the recess by the window. But
      over in one corner I chanced to observe a framed photograph of early
      execution, which hung faded and dim there. Perhaps it was because my
      father was such a scientific amateur; but photography, I found out in
      time, struck the key-note of my history in every chapter. I didn&rsquo;t
      know why, but this particular picture attracted me strangely. It came from
      The Grange, Jane told me: she&rsquo;d hunted it out in the attic over the
      front bedroom after the house was shut up. It belonged to a lot of my
      father&rsquo;s early attempts that were locked in a box there. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
      always been trying experiments and things,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with
      photography, poor gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Faded and dim as it was, the picture riveted my eyes at once by some
      unknown power of attraction. I gazed at it long and earnestly. It
      represented a house of colonial aspect, square, wood-built, and
      verandah-girt, standing alone among strange trees whose very names and
      aspects were then unfamiliar to me, but which I nowadays know to be
      Australian eucalyptuses. On the steps of the verandah sat a lady in deep
      mourning. A child played by her side, and a collie dog lay curled up still
      and sleepy in the foreground. The child, indeed, stirred no chord of any
      sort in my troubled brain; but my heart came up into my mouth so at sight
      of the lady, that I said to myself all at once in my awe, &ldquo;That must
      surely be my mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The longer I looked at it, the more was I convinced I must have judged
      aright. Not indeed that in any true sense I could say I remembered her
      face or figure: I was so young when she died, according to everybody&rsquo;s
      account, that even if I&rsquo;d remained in my First State I could hardly
      have retained any vivid recollection of her. But both lady and house
      brought up in me once more to some vague degree that strange consciousness
      of familiarity I had noticed at The Grange: and what was odder still, the
      sense of wont seemed even more marked in the Australian cottage than in
      the case of the house which all probability would have inclined one
      beforehand to think I must have remembered better. If this was indeed my
      earliest home, then I seemed to recollect it far more readily than my
      later one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned trembling to Jane, hardly daring to frame the question that rose
      first to my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that&mdash;my mother?&rdquo; I faltered out slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there Jane couldn&rsquo;t help me. She&rsquo;d never seen the lady,
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When first I come to The Grange, miss, you see, your mother&rsquo;d
      been buried a year; there was only you and Mr. Callingham in family. And I
      never saw that photograph, neither, till I picked it out of the box locked
      up in the attic. The little girl might be you, like enough, when you look
      at it sideways; and yet again it mightn&rsquo;t. But the lady I don&rsquo;t
      know. I never saw your mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was fain to content myself with pure conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long, however, the new picture haunted me almost as persistently
      as the old one.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I went to sleep fast, and slept for some hours heavily. I woke
      with a start. I had been dreaming very hard. And my dream was peculiarly
      clear and lifelike. Never since the first night of my new life&mdash;the
      night of the murder&mdash;had I dreamed such a dream, or seen dead objects
      so vividly. It came out in clear colours, like the terrible Picture that
      had haunted me so long. And it affected me strangely. It was a scene,
      rather than a dream&mdash;a scene, as at the theatre; but a scene in which
      I realised and recognised everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood on the steps of a house&mdash;a white wooden house, with a
      green-painted verandah&mdash;the very house I had seen that afternoon in
      the faded photograph in Jane&rsquo;s little sitting-room. But I didn&rsquo;t
      think of it at first as the house in the old picture: I thought of it as
      home&mdash;our own place&mdash;the cottage. The steps seemed to me very
      high, as in childish recollection. A lady walked about on the verandah and
      called to me: a lady in a white gown, like the lady in the photograph,
      only younger and prettier, and dressed much more daintily. But I didn&rsquo;t
      think of her as that either: I called her mamma to myself: I looked up
      into her face, oh, ever so much above me: I must have been very small
      indeed when that picture first occurred to me. There was a gentleman, too,
      in a white linen coat, who pinched my mamma&rsquo;s ear, and talked softly
      and musically. But I didn&rsquo;t think of him quite so: I knew he was my
      papa: I played about his knees, a little scampering child, and looked up
      in his face, and teased him and laughed at him. My papa looked down at me,
      and called me a little kitten, and rolled me over on my back, and fondled
      me and laughed with me. There were trees growing all about, big trees with
      long grey leaves: the same sort of trees as the ones in the photograph.
      But I didn&rsquo;t remember that at first: in my dream, and in the first
      few minutes of my waking thought, I knew them at once as the big
      blue-gum-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke in the midst of it: and the picture persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a sudden burst of intuition, the truth flashed upon me all at
      once. My dream was no mere dream, but a revelation in my sleep. It was my
      intellect working unconsciously and spontaneously in an automatic
      condition. For the very first time in my life, since the night of the
      murder, I had really REMEMBERED something that occurred before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a scene of my First State. In all probability it was my earliest
      true childish recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat up in bed, appalled. I dared not call aloud or ring for Jane to come
      to me. But if I&rsquo;d seen a ghost, it could hardly have affected me
      more profoundly than this ghost of my own dead life thus brought suddenly
      back to me. Gazing away across some illimitable vista of dim years, I
      remembered this one scene as something that once occurred, long ago, to my
      very self, in my own experience. Then came a vast gulf, an unbridged
      abyss: and after that, with a vividness as of yesterday, the murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held my ears and crouched low, sitting up in my bed in the dark. But the
      dream seemed to go on still: it remained with me distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more I thought it over, the more certain it appeared as part of my own
      experience. Putting two and two together, I made sure in my own mind this
      was a genuine recollection of my life in Australia. I was born there, I
      knew: that I had learned from everybody. But I could distinctly remember
      having LIVED there now. It came back to me as memory. The dream had
      reinstated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was the sight of the photograph that had produced the dream. This
      was curious, very. A weird idea came across me. Had I begun, in all past
      efforts to remember, at the wrong end? Instead of trying to recollect the
      circumstances that immediately preceded the murder, ought I to have set
      out by trying to reinstate my First Life, chapter by chapter and verse by
      verse, from childhood upward? Ought I to start by recalling as far as
      possible my very earliest recollections in my previous existence, and then
      gradually work up through all my subsequent history to the date of the
      murder?
    </p>
    <p>
      The more I thought of it, the more convinced was I that that was the right
      procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly significant that this vague childish recollection of
      something which might have happened when I was just about two years old
      should be the very first thing to recur to my my memory. Yet so appalled
      and alarmed was I by the weirdness of this sudden apparition, looming up,
      as it were, all by itself in the depths of my consciousness, that I hardly
      dared bring myself to think of trying to recall any other scenes of that
      dead and past existence. The picture rose like an exhalation, hanging
      unrelated in mid-air, a mere mental mirage: and it terrified me so much,
      that I shrank unutterably from the effort of calling up another of like
      sort to follow it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; HATEFUL SUSPICIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rest of that night I lay awake in my bed, the scene in the verandah by
      the big blue-gum-trees haunting me all the time, much as in earlier days
      the Picture of the murder had pursued and haunted me. Early in the morning
      I rose up, and went down to Jane in her little parlour. I longed for
      society in my awe. I needed human presence. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to be
      left alone by myself with all these pressing and encompassing mysteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; I said after a few minutes&rsquo; careless talk&mdash;for
      I didn&rsquo;t like to tell her about my wonderful dream,&mdash;&ldquo;where
      exactly did you find the picture of that house hanging over in the corner
      there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless your heart, miss,&rdquo; Jane answered, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      a whole boxful of them at The Grange. Nobody ever cared for them. They&rsquo;re
      up in the top attic. They were locked till your papa died, and then they
      were opened by order of the executors. Some of &lsquo;em&rsquo;s faded
      even worse than that one, and none of &lsquo;em&rsquo;s very good; but I
      picked this one out because it was better worth framing for my room than
      most of ‘em. The executors took no notice when they found what they was.
      They opened the box to see if it was dockyments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jane,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I shall go up and bring them
      every one away with me. It&rsquo;s possible they may help me to recollect
      things a bit.&rdquo; I drew my hand across my forehead. &ldquo;It all
      seems so hazy,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;Yet when I see things again, I
      sometimes feel as if I almost recognised them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So that very morning we went up together (I wouldn&rsquo;t go alone), and
      got the rest of the photographs&mdash;very faded positives from
      old-fashioned plates, most of them representing persons and places I had
      never seen; and a few of them apparently not taken in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t look them all over at once just then. I thought it best not
      to do so. I would give my memory every possible chance. Take a few at a
      time, and see what effect they produced on me. Perhaps&mdash;though I
      shrank from the bare idea with horror&mdash;they might rouse in my sleep
      such another stray effort of spontaneous reconstruction. Yet the last one
      had cost me much nervous wear and tear&mdash;much mental agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after, I went away from Woodbury. I had learned for the moment,
      I thought, all that Woodbury could teach me: and I longed to get free
      again for a while from this pervading atmosphere of mystery. At Aunt Emma&rsquo;s,
      at least, all was plain and aboveboard. I would go back to
      Barton-on-the-Sea, and rest there for a while, among the heathery hills,
      before proceeding any further on my voyage of discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I took back Jane with me. I was fond of Jane now. In those two short
      weeks I had learned to cling to her. Though I remembered her, strictly
      speaking, no more than at first, yet the affection I must have borne her
      in my First State seemed to revive in me very easily, like all other
      emotions. I was as much at home with Jane, indeed, as if I had known her
      for years. And this wasn&rsquo;t strange; for I HAD known her for years,
      in point of fact; and and though I&rsquo;d forgotten most of those years,
      the sense of familiarity they had inspired still lived on with me
      unconsciously. I know now that memory resides chiefly in the brain, while
      the emotions are a wider endowment of the nervous system in general; so
      that while a great shock may obliterate whole tracts in the memory, no
      power on earth can ever alter altogether the sentiments and feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jane, she was only too glad to come with me. There were no lodgers
      at present, she said; and none expected. Her sister Elizabeth would take
      care of the rooms, and if any stranger came, why, Lizzie&rsquo;d telegraph
      down at once for her. So I wrote to Aunt Emma to expect us both next day.
      Aunt Emma&rsquo;s, I knew, was a home where I or mine were always welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had never seen Aunt Emma. There had been feud between the families
      while my father lived, so she didn&rsquo;t visit The Grange after my
      mother&rsquo;s death. Aunt Emma had often explained to me in part how all
      that happened. It was the one point in our family history on which she&rsquo;d
      ever been explicit: for she had a grievance there; and what woman on earth
      can ever suppress her grievances? It&rsquo;s our feminine way to air them
      before the world, as it&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s to bury them deep in his own
      breast and brood over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother, she told me, had been a widow when my father married her&mdash;a
      rich young widow. She had gone away, a mere girl, to Australia with her
      first husband, a clergyman, who was lost at sea two or three years after,
      on the voyage home to England without her. She had one little girl by her
      first husband, but the child died quite young: and then she married my
      father, who met her first in Australia while she waited for news of the
      clergyman&rsquo;s safety. Her family always disapproved of the second
      marriage. My father had no money, it seemed; and mamma was well off,
      having means of her own to start with, like Aunt Emma, and having
      inherited also her first husband&rsquo;s property, which was very
      considerable. He had left it to his little girl, and after her to his
      wife; so that first my father, and then I myself, came in, in the end, to
      both the little estates, though my mother&rsquo;s had been settled on the
      children of the first marriage. Aunt Emma always thought my father had
      married for money: and she said he had been hard and unkind to mamma: not
      indeed cruel; he wasn&rsquo;t a cruel man; but severe and wilful. He made
      her do exactly as he wished about everything, in a masterful sort of way,
      that no woman could stand against. He crushed her spirit entirely, Aunt
      Emma told me; she had no will of her own, poor thing: his individuality
      was so strong, that it overrode my mother&rsquo;s weak nature rough-shod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that he was rough. He never scolded her; he never illtreated her; but
      he said to her plainly, &ldquo;You are to do so and so;&rdquo; and she
      obeyed like a child. She never dared to question him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Aunt Emma had always said my mother was badly used, especially in money
      matters&mdash;the money being all, when one came to think of it, her own
      or her first husband&rsquo;s;&mdash;and as a consequence, auntie was never
      invited to The Grange during my father&rsquo;s lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached Barton-on-the-Sea, Jane and I, on our way from Woodbury,
      Aunt Emma was waiting at the station to meet us. To my great
      disappointment, I could see at first sight she didn&rsquo;t care for Jane:
      and I could also see at first sight Jane didn&rsquo;t care for her. This
      was a serious blow to me, for I leaned upon those two more than I leaned
      upon anyone; and I had far too few friends in the world of my own, to
      afford to do without any one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, however, when I went up to my own room to bed, Jane came
      up to help me as she always did at Woodbury. I began at once to tax her
      with not liking Aunt Emma. With a little hesitation, Jane admitted that at
      first sight she hadn&rsquo;t felt by any means disposed to care for her. I
      pressed her hard as to why. Jane held off and prevaricated. That roused my
      curiosity:&mdash;you see, I&rsquo;m a woman. I insisted upon knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, miss, I can&rsquo;t tell you!&rdquo; Jane cried, growing red in
      the face, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to say it out. You oughtn&rsquo;t to
      ask. It&rsquo;ll hurt you to know I even thought such a thing of her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You MUST tell me, Jane,&rdquo; I exclaimed, with a cold shudder of
      terror, half guessing what she meant. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep me in
      suspense. Let me know what it is. I&rsquo;m accustomed to shocks now. I
      know I can stand them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane answered nothing directly. She only held out her coarse red hand and
      asked me, with a face growing pale as she spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that picture of the murder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I produced it from my box, trembling inwardly all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane darted one finger demonstratively at a point in the photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose hand is THAT?&rdquo; she asked with a strange earnestness,
      putting her nail on the murderer&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words escaped me in a cry of horror almost before I was aware of them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Emma&rsquo;s!&rdquo; I said, gasping. &ldquo;I NEVER noticed
      it before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I drew back and stared at it in speechless awe and consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite, quite true. No use in denying it. The figure that escaped
      through the window was dressed in man&rsquo;s clothes, to be sure, and as
      far as one could judge from the foreshortening and the peculiar stoop, had
      a man&rsquo;s form and stature. But the hand was a woman&rsquo;s&mdash;soft,
      and white, and delicate: nay more, the hand, as I said in my haste, was
      line for line Aunt Emma&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment a terrible sinking came over me from head to foot. I trembled
      like an aspen-leaf. Could this, then, be the meaning of Dr. Marten&rsquo;s
      warning, that I should let sleeping dogs lie, lest I should be compelled
      to punish someone whom I loved most dearly? Had Fate been so cruel to me,
      that I had learned to cling most in my Second State to the very criminal
      whose act had blotted out my First? Had I grown to treat like a mother my
      father&rsquo;s murderer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma&rsquo;s hand! Aunt Emma&rsquo;s hand! That was Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
      hand, every touch and every line of it. But no! where were the marks,
      those well-known marks on the palm? I took up the big magnifying-glass
      with which I had often scanned that photograph close before. Not a sign or
      a trace of them. I shut my eyes, and called up again the mental Picture of
      the murder. I looked hard at the phantom-hand in it, that floated like a
      vision, all distinct before my mind&rsquo;s eye. It was flat and smooth
      and white. Not a scar&mdash;not a sign on it. I turned round to Jane, that
      too natural detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I cried hastily, with a quick tone of triumph.
      &ldquo;Aunt Emma&rsquo;s hand is marked on the palm with great gashes and
      cuts. This one&rsquo;s smooth as smooth can be. And so&rsquo;s the one I
      can see in the Picture within me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane drew back with a startled air, and opened her mouth, all agog, to let
      in a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wall!&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;The bottle-glass, don&rsquo;t
      you know! The blood on the top! Whoever did it, climbed over and tore his
      hands. Or HER hands, if it was a woman! That would account for the gashes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was more than I could endure. The coincidence was too crushing. I
      bent down my head on my arms and cried silently, bitterly. I hated Jane in
      my heart for even suggesting it. Yet I couldn&rsquo;t deny to myself for a
      moment the strength and suggestiveness of her half-spoken argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that for a second I believed it true. I could never believe it. Aunt
      Emma, so gentle, so kindly, so sweet: incapable of hurting any living
      thing: the tenderest old lady that breathed upon earth: and my own mother&rsquo;s
      sister, whom I loved as I never before loved anyone! Aunt Emma the
      murderess! The bare idea was preposterous! I couldn&rsquo;t entertain it.
      My whole nature revolted from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, how very slight, after all, was the mere scrap of evidence on
      which Jane ventured to suggest so terrible a charge! A man&mdash;in man&rsquo;s
      clothes&mdash;fairly tall and slim, and apparently dark-haired, but
      stooping so much that he looked almost hump-backed: how different from
      Aunt Emma, with her womanly figure, and her upright gait, and her sweet
      old white head! Why, it was clearly ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, the fact remained that as Jane pointed to the Picture and asked,
      &ldquo;Whose hand is that?&rdquo; the answer came up all spontaneously to
      my lips, without hesitation, &ldquo;Aunt Emma&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat there long in my misery, thinking it over to myself. I didn&rsquo;t
      know what to do. I couldn&rsquo;t go and confide to Aunt Emma&rsquo;s ear
      this new and horrible doubt,&mdash;which was no doubt after all, for I
      KNEW it was impossible. I hated Jane for suggesting it; I hated her for
      telling me. Yet I couldn&rsquo;t be left alone. I was far too terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jane;&rdquo; I cried, looking up to her, and yet despising
      myself for saying it, &ldquo;you must stop here to-night and sleep with
      me. If I&rsquo;m left by myself in the room alone, I know I shall go mad&mdash;I
      can feel it&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane stopped with me and soothed me. She was certainly very kind. Yet I
      felt in a dim underhand sort of way it was treason to Aunt Emma to receive
      her caresses at all after what she had said to me. Though to be sure, it
      was I, not she, who spoke those hateful words. It was I myself who had
      said the hand was Aunt Emma&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I lay awake and thought, the idea flashed across me suddenly, could
      Jane have any grudge of her own against Aunt Emma? Was this a deliberate
      plot? What did she mean by her warnings that I should keep my mind open?
      Why had she said from the very first it was a woman&rsquo;s hand? Did she
      want to set me against my aunt? And was Dr. Marten in league with her? In
      my tortured frame of mind, I felt all alone in the world. I covered my
      head and sobbed in my misery. I didn&rsquo;t know who were my friends and
      who were against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after long watching, I dozed off into an uneasy sleep. Jane had
      already been snoring long beside me. I woke up again with a start. I was
      cold and shuddering. I had dreamed once more the same Australian dream. My
      mamma as before stood gentle beside me. She stooped down and smoothed my
      hair: I could see her face and her form distinctly. And I noticed now she
      was like her sister, Aunt Emma, only younger and prettier, and ever so
      much slighter. And her hand, too, was soft and white like auntie&rsquo;s&mdash;very
      gentle and delicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just there that I woke up&mdash;with the hand before my eyes. Oh,
      how vividly I noted it! Aunt Emma&rsquo;s hand, only younger, and
      unscarred on the palm. The family hand, no doubt: the hand of the Moores.
      I remembered, now, that Aunt Emma had spoken more than once of that family
      peculiarity. It ran through the house, she said. But my hand was quite
      different: not the Moore type at all: I supposed I must have taken it, as
      was natural, from the Callinghams.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in my utter horror and loneliness, a still more awful and
      ghastly thought presented itself to me. This was my mother&rsquo;s hand I
      saw in the picture. Was it my mother, indeed, who wrought the murder? Was
      she living or dead? Had my father put upon her some grievous wrong? Had he
      pretended to get her out of the way? Had he buried her alive, so to speak,
      in some prison or madhouse? Had she returned in disguise from the asylum
      or the living grave to avenge herself and murder him? In my present frame
      of mind, no idea was too wild or too strange for me to entertain. If this
      strain continued much longer, I should go mad myself with suspense and
      horror!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. &mdash; YET ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning my head ached. After all I&rsquo;d suffered, I could hardly
      bear to recur to the one subject that now always occupied my thoughts. And
      yet, on the other hand, I couldn&rsquo;t succeed in banishing it. To
      relieve my mind a little, I took out the photographs I had brought from
      the box at The Grange, and began to sort them over according to probable
      date and subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were of different periods, some old, some newer. I put them together
      in series, as well as I could, by the nature of the surroundings. The most
      recent of all were my father&rsquo;s early attempts at instantaneous
      electric photography&mdash;the attempts which led up at last to his
      automatic machine, the acmegraph, that produced all unconsciously the
      picture of the murder. Some of these comparatively recent proofs
      represented men running and horses trotting: but the best of all, tied
      together with a bit of tape, clearly belonged to a single set, and must
      have been taken at the same time at an athletic meeting. There was one of
      a flat race, viewed from a little in front, with the limbs of the runners
      in seemingly ridiculous attitudes, so instantaneous and therefore so
      grotesquely rigid were they. There was another of a high jump, seen from
      one side at the very moment of clearing the pole, so that the figure
      poised solid in mid-air as motionless as a statue. And there was a third,
      equally successful, of a man throwing the hammer, in which the hammer, in
      the same way, seemed to hang suspended of itself like Mahomet&rsquo;s
      coffin between earth and heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the one that attracted my attention the most was a photograph of an
      obstacle-race, in which the runners had to mount and climb over a wagon
      placed obtrusively sideways across the course on purpose to baffle them.
      This picture was taken from a few yards in the rear; and the athletes were
      seen in it in the most varied attitudes. Some of them were just climbing
      up one side of the wagon: others had mounted to the top ledge of the body:
      and one, standing on the further edge, was in the very act of leaping down
      to the ground in front of him. He was bent double, to spring, with a stoop
      like a hunchback, and balanced himself with one hand held tightly behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my eye fell on that figure, a cold thrill ran through me. For a moment
      I only knew something important had happened. Next instant I realised what
      the thrill portended. I could only see the man&rsquo;s back, to be sure,
      but I knew him in a second. I had no doubt as to who it was. This was HIM&mdash;the
      murderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes! There could be no mistaking that arched round back that had
      haunted me so long in my waking dreams. I knew him at sight. It was the
      man I had seen on the night of the murder getting out of the window!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I was overwrought. Perhaps my fancy ran away with me. But I didn&rsquo;t
      doubt for a second. I rose from my seat, and in a tremulous voice called
      Jane into the room. Without one word I laid both pictures down before her
      together. Jane glanced first at the one, then turned quickly to the other.
      A sharp little cry broke from her lips all unbidden. She saw it as fast
      and as instinctively as I had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; she exclaimed, aghast, and as pale as a
      sheet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, right enough, Miss Una. That&rsquo;s the
      very same back! That&rsquo;s the very same hand! That&rsquo;s the man!
      That&rsquo;s the murderer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, this unanimity was sufficiently startling. For nothing could
      have been more different than the dress in the two cases. In the murder
      scene, the man seemed to wear a tweed suit and knickerbockers,&mdash;he
      was indistinct, as I said before, against the blurred light of the window:
      while in the athletic scene, he wore just a thin jersey and
      running-drawers, cut short at the knee, with his arms and legs bare, and
      his muscles contracted. Yet for all that, we both knew him for the same
      man at once. That stooping back was unmistakable; that position of the
      hand was characteristic and unique. We were sure he was the same man. I
      trembled with agitation. I had a clue to the murderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, strange to say, that wasn&rsquo;t the first thought that occurred to
      my mind. In the relief of the moment, I looked up into Jane&rsquo;s eyes,
      and exclaimed with a sigh of profound relief:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you see how mistaken you were about the hands and Aunt Emma!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane looked close at the hand in the photograph once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s curious,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      a man, sure enough: but he&rsquo;d ought to be a Moore. The palm&rsquo;s
      your aunt&rsquo;s as clear as ever you could paint it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced over her shoulder. She was perfectly right. It was a man beyond
      all doubt, the figure on the wagon. Yet the hand was Aunt Emma&rsquo;s,
      every line and every stroke of it; except, of course, the scars. Those, I
      saw at a glance, were wholly wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I had really a clue to the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet how slight a clue! Just a photograph of men&rsquo;s backs. What men?
      When and where? It was an athletic meeting. Of what club or society? That
      was the next question now I had to answer. Instinctively I made up my mind
      to answer it myself, without giving any notice to the police of my
      discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I should never have been able to answer it at all but for one of
      the photographs which, as I thought, though lying loose by itself, formed
      part of the same series. It represented the end of a hundred-yard race,
      with the winners coming in at the tape by a pavilion with a flag-staff. On
      the staff a big flag was flying loosely in the wind. The folds hid half of
      the words on its centre from sight. But this much at least I could read:
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;ER...OM..OY...LETI...UB.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      I gazed at them long and earnestly. After a minute or two of thought, I
      made out the last two words. The inscription must surely be
      Something-or-other Athletic Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was &ldquo;Er... om.. oy...&rdquo;? That question staggered me.
      Gazing harder at it than ever, I could come to no conclusion. It was the
      name of a place, no doubt: but what place, I knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&rdquo;? No, &ldquo;Ber&rdquo;: just a suspicion of a B came
      round the corner of a fold. If B was the first letter, I might possibly
      identify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the photograph down to Aunt Emma, without telling her what I meant.
      She couldn&rsquo;t bear to think I was ever engaged in thinking of my
      First State at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you read the inscription on that flag, auntie?&rdquo; I asked.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old photograph I picked up in the attic at The
      Grange, and I&rsquo;d like to know, if I could, at what place it was
      taken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma gazed at it long and earnestly. Her colour never changed. Then
      she shook her head quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the place,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
      know the name. I can&rsquo;t quite make it out. That&rsquo;s E, and R, and
      O. You see, the letters in between might be almost anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I wasn&rsquo;t going to be put off, however, with the port thus in sight.
      One fact was almost certain. Wherever that pavilion might be, the murderer
      was there on the day unknown when those photo-graphs were taken. And
      whatever that day might be, my father and the murderer were there
      together. That brought the two into connection, and brought me one step
      nearer a solution than ever the police had been; for hitherto no one had
      even pretended to have the slightest clue to the personality of the man
      who jumped out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into the library and took down the big atlas. Opening the map of
      England and Wales, I began a hopeless search, county by county, from
      Northumberland downward, for any town or village that would fit these
      mysterious letters. It was a wild and foolish idea. In the first place not
      a quarter of the villages were marked in the map; and in the second place,
      my brain soon got muddled and dazed with trying to fit in the names with
      the letters on the flag. Two hours had passed away, and I&rsquo;d only got
      as far down as Lancashire and Durham. And, most probably even so, I would
      never come upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly, a bright idea broke on my brain at once. The Index! The
      Index! Presumably, as no fold seemed to obscure the first words, the name
      began with what looked like a B. That was always something.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man would have thought of that at once, of course: but then, I have the
      misfortune to be only a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to the Index in haste, and looked down it with hurried eyes.
      Almost sooner than I could have hoped, the riddle unread itself. &ldquo;Ber-,
      Berb-, Berc-, Berd-,&rdquo; I read out: &ldquo;Berkshire: Berham:
      Berhampore: that won&rsquo;t do: Berlin: Berling: Bernina: Berry&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      that? Oh, great heavens!&rdquo;&mdash;my brain reeled&mdash;&ldquo;Berry
      Pomeroy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as clear as day. How could I have missed it before? There it seemed
      to stand out almost legible on the flagstaff. I read it now with ease:
      &ldquo;Berry Pomeroy Athletic Club.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up the map once more, following the lines with my fingers, till I
      found the very place where the name was printed. A village in Devonshire,
      not far from Torquay. Yes! That&rsquo;s it; Berry Pomeroy. The murderer
      was there on the day of that athletic meeting!
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart came up into my mouth with mingled horror and triumph. I felt
      like a bloodhound who gets on the trail of his man. I would track him down
      now, no doubt&mdash;my father&rsquo;s murderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no resentment against him, no desire for vengeance. But I had a
      burning wish to free myself from this environing mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wouldn&rsquo;t tell the police or the inspector, however, what clue I
      had obtained. I&rsquo;d find it all out for myself without anyone&rsquo;s
      help. I remembered what Dr. Marten had said, and determined to be wise. I&rsquo;d
      work on my own lines till all was found out: and then, be it who it might,
      I sternly resolved I&rsquo;d let justice be done on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I said nothing even to Jane about the discovery I&rsquo;d just made. I
      said nothing to anybody till we sat down at dinner. Then, in the course of
      conversation, I got on the subject of Devonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; I ventured to ask at last, in a very casual way,
      &ldquo;did I ever, so far as you know, go anywhere near a place called
      Berry Pomeroy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma gave a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, darling, why do you ask?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you remember that, do you? What do you
      want to know for, Una? You can&rsquo;t possibly recollect your Torquay
      visit, surely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I trembled all over. Then I was on the right track!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I ever at Torquay?&rdquo; I asked once more, as firmly as I
      could. &ldquo;And when I was there, did I go over one day to Berry
      Pomeroy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma grew all at once as white as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is wonderful!&rdquo; she cried in an agitated voice. &ldquo;This
      is wonderful&mdash;wonderful! If you can remember that, my child, you can
      remember anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T remember it auntie,&rdquo; I answered, not liking to
      deceive her. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I simply guessed at it. But
      when and why was I at Torquay? Please tell me. And did I go to Berry
      Pomeroy?&rdquo; For I stuck to my point, and meant to get it out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma gazed at me fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went to Torquay, dear,&rdquo; she said in a very slow voice,
      &ldquo;in the spring of the same year your poor father was killed: that&rsquo;s
      more than four years ago. The Willie Moores live at Torquay, and several
      more of your cousins. You went to stop with Willie&rsquo;s wife, and you
      stayed five weeks. I don&rsquo;t know whether you ever went over to Berry
      Pomeroy. You may have, and you mayn&rsquo;t: it&rsquo;s within an easy
      driving distance. Minnie Moore has often written to ask me whether you
      could go there again; Minnie was always fond of you, and thinks you&rsquo;d
      remember her: but I&rsquo;ve been afraid to allow you, for fear it should
      recall sad scenes. She&rsquo;s about your own age, Minnie is; and she&rsquo;s
      a daughter of Willie Moore, who&rsquo;s my own first cousin, and of course
      your dear mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I never hesitated a moment. I was strung up too tightly by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie dear,&rdquo; I said quietly, &ldquo;I go to-morrow to
      Torquay. I must know all now. I must hunt up these people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Auntie knew from my tone it was no use trying to stand in my way any
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, dear,&rdquo; she said resignedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      believe it&rsquo;s good for you: but you must do as you like. You have
      your father&rsquo;s will, Una. You were always headstrong.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; THE VISION RECURS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I hated asking auntie questions, they seemed to worry and distress her so;
      but that evening, in view of my projected visit to Torquay, I was obliged
      to cross-examine her rather closely about many things. I wanted to know
      about my Torquay relations, and as far as possible about my mother&rsquo;s
      family. In the end I learned that the Willie Moores were cousins of ours
      on my mother&rsquo;s side who had never quarrelled with my father, like
      Aunt Emma, and through whom alone accordingly, in the days of my First
      State, Aunt Emma was able to learn anything about me. They had a house at
      Torquay, and connections all around; for the Moores were Devonshire
      people. Aunt Emma was very anxious, if I went down there at all, I should
      stop with Mrs. Moore: for Minnie would be so grieved, she said, if I went
      to an hotel or took private lodgings. But I wouldn&rsquo;t hear of that
      myself. I knew nothing of the Moores&mdash;in my present condition&mdash;and
      I didn&rsquo;t like to trust myself in the hands of those who to me were
      perfect strangers. So I decided on going to the Imperial Hotel, and
      calling on the Moores quietly to pursue my investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another question I asked in the course of the evening. I had wondered
      about it often, and now, in these last straits, curiosity overcame me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Emma,&rdquo; I said unexpectedly after a pause, without one
      word of introduction, &ldquo;how ever did you get those scars on your
      hand? You&rsquo;ve never told me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment, Aunt Emma blushed suddenly crimson like a girl of eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; she answered very gravely, in a low strange tone,
      &ldquo;oh, don&rsquo;t ask me about that, dear. Don&rsquo;t ask me about
      that. You could never understand it.... I got them... in climbing over a
      high stone wall... a high stone wall, with bits of glass stuck on top of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her prohibition, I couldn&rsquo;t help asking one virtual
      question more. I gave a start of horror:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the wall at The Grange!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Emma,
      how wonderful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at me, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the wall at The Grange,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;But I
      don&rsquo;t know how you guessed it.... Oh, Una, don&rsquo;t talk to me
      any more about these things, I implore you. You can&rsquo;t think how they
      grieve me. They distress me unspeakably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Much as I longed to know, I couldn&rsquo;t ask her again after that. She
      was trembling like an aspen-leaf. For some minutes we sat and looked at
      the fireplace in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then curiosity overcame me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one question more, auntie,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;When I came
      to you first, you were at home here at Barton. You didn&rsquo;t come to
      Woodbury to fetch me after the murder. You didn&rsquo;t attend the
      inquest. I&rsquo;ve often wondered at that. Why didn&rsquo;t you bring me
      yourself? Why didn&rsquo;t you hurry to nurse me as soon as you heard they&rsquo;d
      shot my father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma gazed at me again with a face like a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she said, quivering, &ldquo;I was ill. I was in
      bed. I was obliged to stay away. I&rsquo;d hurt myself badly a little
      before.... Oh, Una, leave off! If you go on like this, you&rsquo;ll drive
      me mad. Say no more, I implore of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t think what this meant; but as auntie wished it, I held my
      peace, all inwardly trembling with suppressed excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, when I went up to bed, I lay awake long, thinking to myself of
      the Australian scene. In the silence of the night it came back to me
      vividly. Rain pattered on the roof, and helped me to remember it. I could
      see the blue-gum trees waving their long ribbon-like leaves in the wind: I
      could see the cottage, the verandah, my mother, our dog: nay, even, I
      remembered now, with a burst of recollection, his name was Carlo. The
      effort was more truly a recollection than before: it was part of myself: I
      felt aware it was really I myself, not another, who had seen all this, and
      lived and moved in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly I fell asleep, and passed from thinking to dreaming. My dream was
      but a prolongation of the thoughts I had been turning over in my waking
      mind. I was still in Australia; still on the verandah of our wooden house;
      and my mamma was there, and papa beside her. I knew it was papa; for I
      held his hand and played with him. But he was so much altered, so grave
      and severe; though he smiled at me good-humouredly. Mamma was sitting
      behind, with baby on her lap. It seemed to me quite natural she should be
      there with baby. The scene was so distinct&mdash;very vivid and clear. It
      persisted for many minutes, perhaps even hours. It burnt itself into my
      brain. At last, it woke me up by its very intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I woke, a great many thoughts crowded in upon me all at once. This time
      I knew instantly it was no mere dream, but a true recollection. Yet what a
      strange recollection! how unexpected! how incomprehensible! How much in it
      to settle! how much to investigate and hunt up and inquire about!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, though I was still in my dream a little girl, much
      time must have elapsed since the earlier vision; for my papa looked far
      older, and graver, and sterner. He had more hair about his face, too, a
      long brown beard and heavy moustache; and when I gazed hard at him
      mentally, I could recognise the likeness with the white-bearded man who
      lay dead on the floor: while in my former recollection, I could scarcely
      make out any resemblance of the features. This showed that the second
      scene came long after the first: my father must by that time have begun to
      resemble his later self. A weird feeling stole over me. Was I going to
      relive my previous life, piecemeal? Was the past going to unroll itself in
      slow but regular panorama to my sleeping vision? Was my First State to
      become known like this in successive scenes to my Second?
    </p>
    <p>
      But that wasn&rsquo;t all. There were strange questions to decide, too,
      about this new dream of dead days. What could be the meaning of that
      mysterious baby? She seemed to be so vivid, so natural, so real; her
      presence there was so much a pure matter of course to me, that I couldn&rsquo;t
      for a moment separate her from the rest of the Picture. I REMEMBERED the
      baby, now; as I remembered my mother, and my father, and Australia. There
      was no room for doubt as to that. The baby was an integral part of my real
      recollection. Floating across the dim ocean of years, I was certain that
      night I had once lived in such a scene, with my mamma, and baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet oh, what baby? I never had a brother or sister of my own, except the
      half-sister that died&mdash;the clergyman&rsquo;s child, Mary Wharton. And
      Mary, from what I had learned from Aunt Emma and others, must have died
      when I was only just five months old, immediately before we left
      Australia. How, then, could I remember her, even in this exalted mental
      state of trance or dream? And, above all, how could I remember a far
      earlier scene, when my papa was younger, when his face was smooth, and
      when there was no other baby?
    </p>
    <p>
      This mystery only heightened the other mysteries which surrounded my life.
      I was surfeited with them now. In very despair and listlessness, I turned
      round on my side, and dozed dreamily off again, unable to grapple with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still that scene haunted me. And still, even in sleep, I asked myself
      over and over again, &ldquo;How on earth can this be? What&rsquo;s the
      meaning of the baby?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was a little sister that died young, whom I never had heard of.
      And perhaps not. In a life such as mine, new surprises are always
      possible.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; THE MOORES OF TORQUAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Strange to say, in spite of everything, my sleep refreshed me. I woke up
      in the morning strong and vigorous&mdash;thank goodness, I have physically
      a magnificent constitution&mdash;and packed my box, with Jane&rsquo;s
      help, for my Torquay expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to London and down to Torquay alone, though Jane offered to
      accompany me. I was learning to be self-reliant. It suited my plans
      better. Nobody could bear this burden for me but myself; and the sooner I
      learnt to bear it my own way, the happier for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Torquay station, to my great surprise, a fresh-looking girl of my own
      age rushed up to me suddenly, and kissed me without one word of warning.
      She was a very pretty girl, pink-cheeked and hazel-eyed: and as she kissed
      me, she seized both my hands in hers, and cried out to me frankly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there you are, Una dear! Cousin Emma telegraphed us what train
      you&rsquo;d arrive by; so I&rsquo;ve driven down to meet you. And now, you&rsquo;re
      coming up with us this very minute in the pony-carriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Minnie Moore, I suppose?&rdquo; I said, gazing at her
      admiringly. Her sweet, frank smile and apple-blossom cheek somehow
      inspired me with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked back at me quite distressed. Tears rose at once into her eyes
      with true Celtic suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Una,&rdquo; she cried, deeply hurt and drawing back into her
      shell, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t know me! Why, I&rsquo;m
      Minnie! Minnie!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart went out to her at once. I took her hand in mine again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minnie dear,&rdquo; I said softly, quite remorseful for my mistake,
      &ldquo;you must remember what has happened to me, and not be angry. I&rsquo;ve
      forgotten everything, even my own past life. I&rsquo;ve forgotten that I
      ever before set eyes upon you. But, my dear, there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve
      NOT in a way forgotten; and that is, that I loved you and love you dearly.
      And I &lsquo;ll give you a proof of it. When I started, I knew none of
      you; and I told Aunt Emma I wouldn&rsquo;t go among strangers. The moment
      I see you, I know you&rsquo;re no stranger, but a very dear cousin. When I&rsquo;ve
      forgotten MYSELF, how can I remember YOU? But I&rsquo;ll go up with you at
      once. And I&rsquo;ll countermand the room I ordered by telegram at the
      Imperial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears stood fuller in Minnie&rsquo;s eyes than before. She clasped my
      hand hard. Her pretty lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we always were friends, and we
      always shall be. If you love me, that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;re a darling.
      I love you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her sweet face, and knew it was true. And oh, I was so glad to
      have a new friend&mdash;an old friend, already! For somehow, as always,
      while the intellectual recollection had faded, the emotion survived. I
      felt as if I&rsquo;d known Minnie Moore for years, though I never
      remembered to have seen her in my life till that minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I remained at the Moores&rsquo; for a week, and felt quite at home
      there. They were all very nice, Cousin Willie, and Aunt Emily (she made me
      call her aunt; she said I&rsquo;d always done so), and Minnie, and all of
      them. They were really dear people; and blood, after all, is thicker than
      water. But I made no haste to push inquiries just at first. I preferred to
      feel my way. I wanted to find out what they knew, if anything, about Berry
      Pomeroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time I ventured to mention the subject to Minnie, she gave a
      very queer smile&mdash;a smile of maidenly badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you remember THAT, any way,&rdquo; she said, in a teasing
      little way, looking down at me and laughing. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d
      remember that. I must say you enjoyed yourself wonderfully at Berry
      Pomeroy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember what?&rdquo; I cried, all eagerness; for I saw she
      attached some special importance to the recollection. And yet, it was
      terrible she should jest about the clue to my father&rsquo;s murderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnie looked arch. When she looked arch, she was charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I never saw you prettier or more engaging in your life than
      you were that day,&rdquo; she said evasively, as if trying to pique me.
      &ldquo;And you flirted so much, too! And everybody admired you so.
      Everybody on the grounds... especially one person!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up at her in surprise. I was in my own room, seated by the
      dressing-table, late at night, when we&rsquo;d gone up to bed; and Minnie
      was beside me, standing up, with her bedroom candle in that pretty white
      little hand of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I exclaimed eagerly. &ldquo;Was it a dance&mdash;or
      a picnic?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know very well,&rdquo; Minnie went on teasingly, &ldquo;though
      you pretend you forget. HE was there, don&rsquo;t you know. You must
      remember HIM, if you&rsquo;ve forgotten all the rest of your previous
      life. You say you remember the appropriate emotions. Well, he was an
      emotion: at least, you thought so. It was an Athletic Club Meeting: and
      Dr. Ivor was there. He went across on his bicycle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave a start of surprise. Minnie looked down at me half maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see,&rdquo; she said archly again, &ldquo;at Dr. Ivor
      you change colour. I told you you&rsquo;d remember him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew pale with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minnie dear,&rdquo; I said, holding her hands very tight in my own,
      &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t that, I assure you. I&rsquo;ve forgotten him,
      utterly. If ever I knew a Dr. Ivor, if ever I flirted with him, as you
      seem to imply, he&rsquo;s gone clean out of my head. His name stirs no
      chord&mdash;recalls absolutely nothing. But I want to know about that
      Athletic Meeting. Was my poor father there that day? And did he take a set
      of photographs?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnie clapped her hands triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I KNEW you remembered!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Of course, Cousin
      Vivian was there. We drove over in a break. You MUST remember that. And he
      took a whole lot of instantaneous photographs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My hand trembled violently in my cousin&rsquo;s. I felt I was now on the
      very eve of a great discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minnie,&rdquo; I said, tentatively, &ldquo;do you think your papa
      would drive us over some day and&mdash;and show us the place again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he would, dear,&rdquo; Minnie answered, with a gentle
      pressure of my hand. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be only too delighted. Whatever you
      choose. You know you were always such a favourite of daddy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew nothing of the sort; but I was glad to learn it. I drew Minnie out
      a little more about the Athletics and my visit to Berry Pomeroy. She
      wouldn&rsquo;t tell me much: she was too illusive and indefinite: she
      never could get the notion out of her head, somehow, that I remembered all
      about it, and was only pretending to forgetfulness. But I gathered from
      what she said, that Dr. Ivor and I must have flirted a great deal; or, at
      least, that he must have paid me a good lot of attention. My father didn&rsquo;t
      like it, Minnie said; he thought Dr. Ivor wasn&rsquo;t well enough off to
      marry me. He was a distant cousin of ours, of course&mdash;everything was
      always &ldquo;of course&rdquo; with that dear bright Minnie&mdash;what,
      didn&rsquo;t I know that? Oh, yes, his mother was one of the Moores of
      Barnstaple, cousin Edward&rsquo;s people. His name was Courtenay Moore
      Ivor, you know&mdash;though I knew nothing of the sort. And he was awfully
      clever. And, oh, so handsome!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at Berry Pomeroy still?&rdquo; I asked, trembling, thinking
      this would be a good person to get information from about the people at
      the Athletic Sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no,&rdquo; Minnie answered, looking hard at me, curiously.
      &ldquo;He was never at Berry Pomeroy. He had a practice at Babbicombe. He&rsquo;s
      in Canada now, you know. He went over six months after Cousin Vivian&rsquo;s
      death. I think, dear,&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated,&mdash;&ldquo;he never
      QUITE got over your entirely forgetting him, even if you forgot your whole
      past history.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a curious romance to me, that Minnie thus sprang on me&mdash;a
      romance of my own past life of which I myself knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat late talking, and I could see Minnie was very full indeed of Dr.
      Ivor. Over and over again she recurred to his name, and always as though
      she thought it might rouse some latent chord in my memory. But nothing
      came of it. If ever I had cared for Dr. Ivor at all, that feeling had
      passed away utterly with the rest of my experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Minnie rose to go, I took her hand once more in mine. As I did so, I
      started. Something about it seemed strangely familiar. I looked at it
      close with a keen glance. Why, this was curious! It was Aunt Emma&rsquo;s
      hand: it was my mother&rsquo;s hand: it was the hand in my mental Picture:
      it was the hand of the murderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like auntie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; I said with an effort,
      seeing Minnie noticed my start.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at it and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Moore hand,&rdquo; she said gaily. &ldquo;We all have it,
      except you. It&rsquo;s awfully persistent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned it over in front and examined the palm. At sight of it my brain
      reeled. This was surely magic! Minnie Moore&rsquo;s hand, too, was scarred
      over with cuts, exactly like Aunt Emma&rsquo;s!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how on earth did you do that?&rdquo; I cried, thunderstruck at
      the discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Minnie only laughed again, a bright girlish laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climbing over that beastly wall at The Grange,&rdquo; she said with
      a merry look. &ldquo;Oh, what fun we did have! We climbed it together. We
      were dreadful tomboys in those days, dear, you and I: but you were luckier
      than I was, and didn&rsquo;t cut yourself with the bottle-glass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too surprising to be passed over unnoticed. When Minnie was gone,
      I lay awake and pondered about it. Had all the Moores got scars on their
      hands, I wondered? And how many people, I asked myself, had cut themselves
      time and again in climbing over that barricaded garden-wall of my father&rsquo;s?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moore hand might be hereditary, but not surely the scars. Was the
      murderer, then, a Moore, and was that the meaning of Dr. Marten&rsquo;s
      warning?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; DR. IVOR OF BABBICOMBE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days later, Cousin Willie drove us over to Berry Pomeroy. The lion of
      the place is the castle, of course; but Minnie had told him beforehand I
      wanted, for reasons of my own, to visit the cricket-field where the sports
      were held &ldquo;the year Dr. Ivor won the mile race, you remember.&rdquo;
      So we went there straight. As soon as we entered, I recognised the field
      at once, and the pavilion, and the woods, as being precisely the same as
      those presented in the photograph. But I got no further than that. The
      captain of the cricket-club was on the ground that day, and I managed to
      get into conversation with him, and strolled off in the grounds. There I
      showed him the photograph, and asked if he could identify the man climbing
      over the wagon: but he said he couldn&rsquo;t recognise him. Somebody or
      other from Torquay, perhaps; not a regular resident. The figures were so
      small, and so difficult to make sure about. If I&rsquo;d leave him the
      photograph, perhaps&mdash;but at that I drew back, for I didn&rsquo;t want
      anybody, least of all at Torquay, to know what quest I was engaged upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove back, a merry party enough, in spite of my failure. Minnie was
      always so jolly, and her mirth was contagious. She talked all the way
      still of Dr. Ivor, half-teasing me. It was all very well my pretending not
      to remember, she said; but why did I want to see the cricket-field if it
      wasn&rsquo;t for that? Poor Courtenay! if only he knew, how delighted he&rsquo;d
      be to know he wasn&rsquo;t forgotten! For he really took it to heart, my
      illness&mdash;she always called it my illness, and so I suppose it was.
      From the day I lost my memory, nothing seemed to go right with him; and he
      was never content till he went and buried himself somewhere in the wilds
      of Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening again, I sat with Minnie in my room. I was depressed and
      distressed. I didn&rsquo;t want to cry before Minnie, but I could have
      cried with good heart for sheer vexation. Of course I couldn&rsquo;t bear
      to go showing the photograph to all the world, and letting everybody see I&rsquo;d
      made myself a sort of amateur detective. They would mistake my motives so.
      And yet I didn&rsquo;t know how I was ever to find out my man any other
      way. It was that or nothing. I made up my mind I would ask Cousin Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took out the photograph, as if unintentionally, when I went to my box,
      and laid it down with my curling-tongs on the table close by Minnie.
      Minnie took it up abstractedly and looked at it with an indefinite gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this is the cricket-field!&rdquo; she cried, as soon as she
      collected her senses. &ldquo;One of your father&rsquo;s experiments. The
      earliest acmegraphs. How splendidly they come out! See, that&rsquo;s Sir
      Everard at the bottom; and there&rsquo;s little Jack Hillier above; and
      this on one side&rsquo;s Captain Brooks; and there, in front of all&mdash;well,
      you know HIM anyhow, Una. Now, don&rsquo;t pretend you forget! That&rsquo;s
      Courtenay Ivor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her finger was on the man who stood poised ready to jump. With an awful
      recoil, I drew back and suppressed a scream. It was on the tip of my
      tongue to cry out, &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s my father&rsquo;s murderer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, happily, with a great effort of will I restrained myself. I saw it
      all at a glance. That, then, was the meaning of Dr. Marten&rsquo;s
      warning! No wonder, I thought, the shock had disorganised my whole brain.
      If Minnie was right, I was in love once with that man. And I must have
      seen my lover murder my father!
    </p>
    <p>
      For I didn&rsquo;t doubt, from what Minnie said, I had really once loved
      Dr. Ivor. Horrible and ghastly as it might be to realise it, I didn&rsquo;t
      doubt it was the truth. I had once loved the very man I was now bent on
      pursuing as a criminal and a murderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure that&rsquo;s him, Minnie?&rdquo; I cried, trying
      to conceal my agitation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure that&rsquo;s Courtenay
      Ivor, the man stooping on the wagon-top?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnie looked at me, smiling. She thought I was asking for a very
      different reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him, right enough, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      could tell him among a thousand. Why, the Moore hand alone would be quite
      enough to know him by. It&rsquo;s just like my own. We&rsquo;ve all of us
      got it&mdash;except yourself. I always said you weren&rsquo;t one of us.
      You&rsquo;re a regular born Callingham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed at her fixedly. I could hardly speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Minnie!&rdquo; I cried once more, &ldquo;have you ... have you
      any photograph of him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t, dear,&rdquo; Minnie answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a fad of Courtenay&rsquo;s, you know. Wherever he went, he&rsquo;d
      never be photographed. He was annoyed that day that your father should
      have taken him unawares. He hated being &lsquo;done,&rsquo; he said. He&rsquo;s
      so handsome and so nice, but he&rsquo;s not a bit conceited. And he was
      such a splendid bicyclist! He rode over and back on his bicycle that day,
      and then ran in all the races as if it were nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A light burst over me at once. This was circumstantial evidence. The
      murderer who disappeared as if by magic the moment his crime was committed
      must have come and gone all unseen, no doubt, on his bicycle. He must have
      left it under the window till his vile deed was done, and then leapt out
      upon it in a second and dashed off whence he came like a flash of
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a premeditated crime, in that case, not the mere casual result of a
      sudden quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must find out this man now, were it only to relieve my own sense of
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minnie,&rdquo; I said once more, screwing up my courage to ask,
      &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Dr. Ivor now? I mean&mdash;that is to say&mdash;in
      what part of Canada?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnie looked at me and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I told you so!&rdquo; she said, merrily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      not the least bit of use your pretending you&rsquo;re not in love with
      him, Una. Why, just look how you tremble! You&rsquo;re as white as a
      ghost! And then you say you don&rsquo;t care for poor Courtenay! I forget
      the exact name of the place where he lives, but I&rsquo;ve got it in my
      desk, and I can tell you to-morrow.&mdash;Oh, yes; it&rsquo;s Palmyra, on
      the Canada Pacific. I suppose you want to write to him. Or perhaps you
      mean to go out and offer yourself bodily.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was awful having to bottle up the truth in one&rsquo;s own heart, and
      to laugh and jest like this; but I endured it somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; I said gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      other reasons of my own for asking his address, Minnie. I want to go out
      there, it&rsquo;s true; but not because I cherish the faintest pleasing
      recollection of Dr. Ivor in any way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnie scanned me over in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how you ARE altered, Una!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I love
      you, dear, and like you every bit as much as ever. But you&rsquo;ve
      changed so much. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re at all what you used to
      be. You&rsquo;re so grave and sombre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder, Minnie,&rdquo; I exclaimed, bursting gladly into tears&mdash;the
      excuse was such a relief&mdash;&ldquo;no wonder, when you think how much I&rsquo;ve
      passed through!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnie flung her arms around my neck, and kissed me over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she cried, melting. &ldquo;What have I done? What
      have I said? I ought never to have spoken so. It was cruel of me&mdash;cruel,
      Una dear. I shall stop here to-night, and sleep with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, darling!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Minnie, that IS good
      of you. I&rsquo;m so awfully glad. For to-morrow I must be thinking of
      getting ready for Canada.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canada!&rdquo; Minnie exclaimed, alarmed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
      really going to Canada! Oh, Una, you&rsquo;re joking! You don&rsquo;t mean
      to say you&rsquo;re going out there to find him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I took her hand in mine, and held it up in the air above her head
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear cousin,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I love you. But you must promise
      me this one thing. Whatever may happen, give me your sacred word of honour
      you&rsquo;ll never tell anybody what we&rsquo;ve said here to-night. You&rsquo;ll
      kill me if you do. I don&rsquo;t want any living soul on earth to know of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke so seriously, Minnie felt it was important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you,&rdquo; she answered, growing suddenly far graver
      than her wont. &ldquo;Oh, Una, I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea what you
      mean, but no torture on earth shall ever wring a word of it from me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I went to bed in her arms, and cried myself to sleep, thinking with my
      latest breath, in a tremor of horror, that I&rsquo;d found it at last.
      Courtenay Ivor was the name of my father&rsquo;s murderer!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; MY WELCOME TO CANADA
    </h2>
    <p>
      The voyage across the Atlantic was long and uneventful. No whales, no
      icebergs, no excitement of any sort. My fellow-passengers said it was as
      dull as it was calm. But as for me, I had plenty to occupy my mind
      meanwhile. Strange things had happened in the interval, and were happening
      to me on the way. Strange things, in part, of my own internal history.
    </p>
    <p>
      For before I left England, as I sat with Aunt Emma in her little
      drawing-room at Barton-on-the-Sea, discussing my plans and devising routes
      westward, she made me, quite suddenly, an unexpected confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; she said, after a long pause, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t
      told me, my dear, why you&rsquo;re going to Canada. And I don&rsquo;t want
      to ask you. I know pretty well. We needn&rsquo;t touch upon that. You&rsquo;re
      going to hunt up some supposed clue to the murderer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so, Auntie,&rdquo; I said oracularly: &ldquo;and perhaps
      not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For I didn&rsquo;t want it to get talked about and be put into all the
      newspapers. And I knew now if I wanted to keep it out, I must first be
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Emma drew nearer and took my hand in hers. At the same time, she held
      up the other scarred and lacerated palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know when I got that, Una?&rdquo; she asked with a sudden
      burst. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, my child.... It was the night of
      your father&rsquo;s death. And I got it climbing over the wall at The
      Grange, to escape detection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My blood ran cold once more. What on earth could this mean? Had Auntie&mdash;?
      But no. I had the evidence of my own senses that it was Courtenay Ivor. I&rsquo;d
      tracked him down now. There was no room for doubt. The man on the wagon
      was the man who fired the shot. I could have sworn to that bent back, of
      my own knowledge, among a thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hadn&rsquo;t long to wait, however. Auntie went on after a short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;by accident, trying for once
      to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her fixedly still, and still I said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was stopping with friends at the time, ten miles off from
      Woodbury,&rdquo; Aunt Emma went on, smoothing my hand with hers, &ldquo;and
      I longed so to see you. I came over by train that day, and stopped late
      about the town in hopes I might meet you in the street. But I was
      disappointed. Towards evening I ventured even to go into the grounds of
      The Grange, and look about everywhere on the chance that I might see you.
      Perhaps your father might be out. I went round towards the window, which I
      now know to be the library. As I went, I saw a bicycle leaning up against
      the wall by the window. I thought that must be some visitor, but still I
      went on. But just as I reached the window, I saw a flash of electric
      light; and by the light, I could make out your father&rsquo;s head and
      beard. He looked as if he were talking angrily and loudly to somebody. The
      window was open. I was afraid to stop longer. In a sudden access of fear,
      I ran across the shrubbery towards the garden-wall. To tell you the truth,
      I was horribly frightened. Why, I don&rsquo;t know; for nothing had
      happened as yet. I suppose it was just the dusk and the mean sense of
      intrusion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused and wiped her brow. I sat still, and listened eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; she went on, very low, &ldquo;as I ran and ran, I
      heard behind me a loud crash&mdash;a sound as of a pistol-shot. That
      terrified me still more. I thought I was being pursued. Perhaps they took
      me for a burglar. In the agony of my terror, I rushed at the wall in mad
      haste, and climbed over it anyhow. In climbing, I tore my hand, as you
      see, and made myself bleed, oh, terribly! However, I persevered, and got
      down on the other side, with my clothes very little the worse for the
      scramble. And, fortunately, I was carrying a small light dust-cloak: I put
      it on at once, and it covered up everything. Then I began to walk along
      the road as fast as I could in the direction of the station. As I did so,
      a bicycle shot out from the gate in the opposite direction, going as hard
      as it could spin, simply flying towards Whittingham. Three minutes later,
      a man came up to me, breathless. It was the gardener at The Grange, I
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Have you seen anybody go this way?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;A
      young man, running hard? A young man in knickerbockers?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;N&mdash;no,&rsquo; I answered, trembling; for I was afraid
      to confess. &lsquo;Not a soul has gone past!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I didn&rsquo;t know of the murder as yet; and I only
      wanted to get off unperceived to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d bound up my hand in my handkerchief by that time, and
      held it tight under my cloak. I went back by train unnoticed, and returned
      to my friends&rsquo; house. I hadn&rsquo;t even told them I was going to
      Woodbury at all. I pretended I&rsquo;d been spending the day at
      Whittingham. Next morning, I read in the paper of your father&rsquo;s
      murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared hard at Aunt Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this long ago?&rdquo; I cried, in an
      agony of suspense. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you give evidence and say so at
      the inquest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; Aunt Emma answered, looking back at me
      appealingly. &ldquo;The circumstances were too suspicious. As it was,
      everybody was running after the young man in knickerbockers. Nobody took
      any notice of a little old lady in a long grey dust-cloak. But if once I&rsquo;d
      confessed and shown my wounded hand, who would ever have believed I&rsquo;d
      nothing to do with the murder?&mdash;except you, perhaps, Una. Oh no: I
      came back here to my own home as fast as ever I could; for I was really
      ill. I took to my bed at once. And as nobody called me to give evidence at
      the inquest, I said nothing to anybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the bicycle!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;The bicycle! You ought to
      have mentioned that. You were the only one who saw it. It was a clue to
      the murderer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d told,&rdquo; Aunt Emma answered, &ldquo;I should never
      have been allowed to take charge of you at all. I thought my one clear
      duty was to my sister&rsquo;s child: it was to take care of your health in
      your shattered condition. And even now, Una, I tell you only for this: if
      you find out anything new, in Canada or here, try not to drag me into it.
      I couldn&rsquo;t stand the strain. Cross-examination would kill me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember it, auntie,&rdquo; I said, wearied out with
      excitement. &ldquo;But I think you did wrong, all the same. In a case like
      this, it&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s first duty to tell all he knows, in the
      interests of justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this confession of Aunt Emma&rsquo;s rendered one thing more
      certain to me than ever before. I was sure I was on the right track now,
      after Courtenay Ivor. The bicycle clinched the proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I said nothing as yet to the police, or to my friendly Inspector. I
      was determined to hunt the whole thing up on my own account first, and
      then deliver my criminal, when fully secured, to the laws of my country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that I was vindictive. Not that I wanted to punish the man. No; I
      shrank terribly from the task. But to relieve myself from this persistent
      sense of surrounding mystery, and to free others from suspicion, I felt
      compelled to discover him. It seemed to me like a duty laid upon me from
      without. I dared not shirk it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way out to Quebec, the sea seemed to revive strange memories. I had
      never crossed it before, except long, long ago, on my way home from
      Australia. And now that I sat on deck, in a wicker-chair, and looked at
      the deep dark waves by myself, I began once more, in vague snatches, to
      recall that earlier voyage. It came back to me all of itself. And that was
      quite in keeping with my previous recollections. My past life, I felt
      sure, was unfolding itself slowly to me in regular succession, from
      childhood onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there on the quarter-deck, gazing hard at the waves, I remembered
      how I had played on a similar ship years and years before, a little girl
      in short frocks, with my mamma in a long folding-chair beside me. I could
      see my mamma, with a sort of frightened smile on her poor pale face; and
      she looked so unhappy. My papa was there too, somewhat older and greyer&mdash;very
      unlike the papa of my first Australian picture. His face was so much
      hairier. Mamma cried a good deal at times, and papa tried to comfort her.
      Besides, what struck me most, there was no more baby. I wasn&rsquo;t even
      allowed to speak about baby. That subject was tabooed&mdash;perhaps
      because it always made mamma cry so much, and press me hard to her bosom.
      At any rate, I remembered how once I spoke of baby to some
      fellow-passenger in the saloon, and papa was very angry, and caught me up
      in his arms and took me down to my berth; and there I had to stop all day
      by myself (though it was rolling hard) and could have no fruit for dinner,
      because I&rsquo;d been naughty. I was strictly enjoined never to mention
      baby to anyone again, either then or at any time. I was to forget all
      about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day, as we sailed on, reminiscences of the same sort crowded
      thicker and thicker upon me. Never reminiscences of my later life, but
      always early scenes brought up by distinct suggestion of that Australian
      voyage. When we passed a ship, it burst upon me how we&rsquo;d passed such
      ships before: when there was fire-drill on deck, I remembered having
      assisted years earlier at just such fire-drill. The whole past came back
      like a dream, so that I could reconstruct now the first five or six years
      of my life almost entirely. And yet, even so there was a gap, a puzzle, a
      difficulty somehow. I couldn&rsquo;t make the chronology of this
      slow-returning memory fit in as it ought with the chronology of the facts
      given to me by Aunt Emma and the Moores of Torquay. There was a constant
      discrepancy. It seemed to me that I must be a year or two older at least
      than they made me out. I remembered the voyage home far too well for my
      age. I fancied I went back further in my Australian recollections than
      would be possible from the dates Aunt Emma assigned me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, as I compared these mental pictures of my first childhood one with
      the other, a strange fact seemed to loom forth, incomprehensible,
      incredible. When first it struck me, all unnerved as I was, my reason
      staggered before it. But it was true, none the less: quite true, I felt
      certain. Had I had two papas, then?&mdash;for the pictures differed so.
      Was one, clean-shaven, trim, and in a linen coat, the same as the other,
      older, graver, and sterner, with much hair on his face, and a rough sort
      of look, whom I saw more persistently in my later childish memories? I
      could hardly believe it. One man couldn&rsquo;t alter so greatly in a few
      short years. Yet I thought of them both alike quite unquestioningly as
      papa: I thought of them too, I fancied, in a dim sort of way, as one and
      the same person.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fresh mysteries occupied my mind for the greater part of that
      uneventful voyage. To throw them off, I laughed and talked as much as
      possible with the rest of the passengers. Indeed, I gained the reputation
      of being &ldquo;an awfully jolly girl,&rdquo; so heartily did I throw
      myself into all the games and amusements, to escape from the burden of my
      pressing thoughts: and I believe many old ladies on board were thoroughly
      scandalised that a woman whose father had been brutally murdered should
      ever be able to seem so bright and lively again. How little they knew! And
      what a world of mystery seemed to oppress and surround me!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, early one morning, we reached the Gulf, and took in our pilot off
      the Straits of Belleisle. I was on deck at the time, playing a game called
      &ldquo;Shovelboard.&rdquo; As the pilot reached the ship, he took the
      captain&rsquo;s hand, and, to my immense surprise, said in an audible
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve the famous Miss Callingham for a passenger, I hear,
      this voyage. There&rsquo;s the latest Quebec papers. You&rsquo;ll see you&rsquo;re
      looked for. Our people are expecting her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I rushed forward, fiery hot, and with a trembling hand took one of the
      papers he was distributing all round, right and left, to the people on
      deck. It was unendurable that the memory of that one event should thus dog
      me through life with such ubiquitous persistence. I tore open the sheet.
      There, with horrified eyes, I read this hateful paragraph, in the
      atrociously vulgar style of Transatlantic journalism:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sarmatian, expected off Belleisle to-morrow morning, brings
      among her passengers, as we learn by telegram, the famous Una Callingham,
      whose connection with the so-called Woodbury Mystery is now a matter of
      historical interest. The mysterious two-souled lady possesses, at present,
      all her faculties intact, as before the murder, and is indeed, people say,
      a remarkably spry and intelligent young person; but she has most
      conveniently forgotten all the events of her past life, and more
      particularly the circumstances of her father&rsquo;s death, which is
      commonly conjectured to have been due to the pistol of some unknown lover.
      Such freaks of memory are common, we all know, in the matter of small
      debts and of newspaper subscriptions, but they seldom extend quite so far
      as the violent death of a near relation. However, Una knows her own
      business best. The Sarmatian is due alongside the Bonsecours Quay at 10
      a.m. on Wednesday, the 10th; and all Quebec will, no doubt, be assembled
      at the landing-stage to say &lsquo;Good-morning&rsquo; to the two-souled
      lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper dropped from my hand. This was too horrible for anything! How I
      was ever to go through the ordeal of the landing at Quebec after that, I
      hadn&rsquo;t the faintest conception. And was I to be dogged and annoyed
      like this through all my Canadian trip by anonymous scribblers? Had these
      people no hearts? no consideration for the sensitiveness of an English
      lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked over the side of the ship at the dark-blue water. Oh, how I
      longed to plunge into it and be released for ever from this abiding
      nightmare!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; A NEW ACQUAINTANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The moment we reached the quay at Quebec, some two days later, a dozen
      young men, with little notebooks in their hands, jumped on board all at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Callingham!&rdquo; they cried with one accord, making a dash
      for the quarter-deck. &ldquo;Which is she? Oh, this!&mdash;If you please,
      Miss Callingham, I should like to have ten minutes of your time to
      interview you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I clapped my hands to my ears, and stood back, all horrified. What I
      should have done, I don&rsquo;t know, but for a very kind man in a big
      rough overcoat, who had jumped on board at the same time, and made over to
      me like the reporters. He stepped up to me at once, pushed aside the young
      men, and said in a most friendly tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Callingham, I think? You&rsquo;d better come with me, then.
      These people are all sharks. Everybody in Quebec&rsquo;s agog to see the
      Two-souled Lady. Answer no questions at all. Take not the least notice of
      them. Just follow me to the Custom House. Let them rave, but don&rsquo;t
      speak to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I asked blindly, clinging to his arm in my
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a policeman in plain clothes,&rdquo; my new friend
      answered; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been specially detailed by order for this
      duty. I&rsquo;m here to look after you. You&rsquo;ve friends in Canada,
      though you may have quite forgotten them. They&rsquo;ve sent me to help
      you. Those are two of my chums there, standing aside by the gangway. We&rsquo;ll
      walk you off between us. Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&mdash;Here, you sir,
      there; make way!&mdash;No one shall come near you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so nervous, and so ashamed that I accepted my strange escort without
      inquiry or remonstrance. He helped me, with remarkable politeness for a
      common policeman, across to the Custom House, where I sat waiting for my
      luggage. Reporters and sightseers, meanwhile, pressed obtrusively around
      me. My protector held them back. I was half wild with embarrassment. I&rsquo;m
      naturally a reserved and somewhat sensitive girl, and this American
      publicity made me crimson with bashfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat there waiting, however, the two other policemen to whom my
      champion had beckoned sat one on each side of me, keeping off the idle
      crowd, while my first friend looked after the luggage and saw it safely
      through the Customs for me. He must be an Inspector, I fancied, or some
      other superior officer, the officials were so deferential to him. I gave
      him my keys, and he looked after everything himself. I had nothing, for my
      part, to do but to sit and wait patiently for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had finished, he called a porter to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vite!&rdquo; he cried, in a tone of authority, to the man. &ldquo;Un
      fiacre!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the porter called one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started to find that I knew what he meant. Till that moment, in my
      Second State, I had learned no French, and didn&rsquo;t know I could speak
      any. But I recognised the words quite well as soon as he uttered them. My
      lost knowledge reasserted itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bundled on my boxes. The crowd still stood around and gaped at me,
      open-mouthed. I got into the cab, more dead than alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allez!&rdquo; my policeman cried to the French-Canadian driver,
      seating himself by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A la gare du chemin de fer Pacific! Aussi vite que possible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I understood every word. This was wonderful. My memory was coming back
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man tore along the streets to the Pacific railway station. By the time
      we reached it we had distanced the sightseers, though some of them gave
      chase. My policeman got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train&rsquo;s just going!&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      take a ticket for Palmyra, if you don&rsquo;t want to be followed and
      tracked out all the way. They&rsquo;ll telegraph on your destination. Book
      to Kingston instead, and then change at Sharbot Lake, and take a second
      ticket on from there to Palmyra.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened, half dazed. Palmyra was the place where Dr. Ivor lived. Yet,
      even in the hurry of the moment, I wondered much to myself how the
      policeman knew I wanted to go to Palmyra.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to ask questions, however, or to deliberate on my plans.
      I took my ticket as desired, in a turmoil of feelings, and jumped on to
      the train. I trusted by this time I had eluded detection. I ought to have
      come, I saw now, under a feigned name. This horrid publicity was more than
      I could endure. My policeman helped me in with his persistent politeness,
      and saw my boxes checked as far as Sharbot Lake for me. Then he handed me
      the checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in the Pullman,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long
      journey, you know: four-and-twenty hours. You&rsquo;ve only just caught
      it. But if you&rsquo;d stopped in Quebec, you&rsquo;d never have been able
      to give the sightseers the slip. You&rsquo;d have been pestered all
      through. I think you&rsquo;re safe now. It was this or nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you so much!&rdquo; I cried, with heartfelt gratitude,
      leaning out of the window as the train was on the point of starting. I
      pulled out my purse, and drew timidly forth a sovereign. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      only English money,&rdquo; I said, hesitating, for I didn&rsquo;t know
      whether he&rsquo;d be offended or not at the offer of a tip&mdash;he
      seemed such a perfect gentleman. &ldquo;But if that&rsquo;s any use to you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled a broad smile and shook his head, much amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; he said, half laughing, with a very curious
      air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a policeman, as I told you. But I don&rsquo;t need
      tips. I&rsquo;m the Chief Constable of Quebec&mdash;there&rsquo;s my card;
      Major Tascherel,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m glad to be of use, I&rsquo;m sure, to
      any friend of Dr. Ivor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hat with the inborn grace of a high-born gentleman. I
      coloured and bowed. The train steamed out of the station. As it went, I
      fell back, half fainting, in the comfortable armchair of the Pullman car,
      hardly able to speak with surprise and horror. It was all so strange, so
      puzzling, so bewildering! Then I owed my escape from the stenographic
      myrmidons of the Canadian Press to the polite care and attention of my
      father&rsquo;s murderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Tascherel was a friend, he said, of Dr. Ivor&rsquo;s!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Dr. Ivor knew I had come. He knew I was going to Palmyra to find him.
      And yet he had written to Quebec, apparently, expecting this crush, and
      asking his friend the Chief Constable to protect and befriend me. Had he
      murdered my father, and was he in love with me still? Did he think I&rsquo;d
      come out, not to track him down, but to look for him? Strange, horrible
      questions! My heart stood still within me at this extraordinary
      revelation. Yet I was so frightened at the moment, alone in a strange
      land, that I felt almost grateful to the murderer himself for his kindness
      in thinking of me and providing for my reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I settled in my seat and had time to realise what these things meant,
      it dawned upon me by degrees that all this was less remarkable, after all,
      than I first thought it. For they had telegraphed from England that I
      sailed on the Sarmatian; and Dr. Ivor, like everybody else, must have read
      the telegram. He might naturally conclude I would be half-mobbed by
      reporters; and as it was clear he had once been fond of me&mdash;hateful
      as I felt it even to admit the fact to myself&mdash;he might really have
      desired to save me annoyance and trouble. It was degrading, to be sure,
      even to think I owed anything of any sort to such a wretch as that
      murderer; yet in a certain corner of my heart I couldn&rsquo;t help being
      thankful to him. But how strange to feel I had come there on purpose to
      hunt him down! How horrible that I must so repay good with evil!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a still more ghastly thought surged up suddenly in my mind. Why on
      earth did he think I was going to Palmyra? Was it possible he fancied I
      loved him still&mdash;that I wanted to marry him? Could he imagine I&rsquo;d
      come out just to fling myself at his feet and ask him to take me? Could he
      suppose I&rsquo;d forgotten all the rest of my past life, and his vile act
      as well, and yet remembered alone what little love, if any, I ever had
      borne him? It was incredible that any man, however wicked, however
      conceited, should think such folly as that&mdash;that a girl would marry
      her father&rsquo;s murderer; and yet what might not one expect from a man
      who, after having shot my father, had still the inconceivable and
      unbelievable audacity to take deliberate steps for securing my own comfort
      and happiness? From such a wretch as that, one might look for almost
      anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten minutes or more, as we whirled along the line in the Pullman car,
      I was too dazed and confused to notice anything around me. My brain swam
      vaguely, filled full with wild whirling thoughts; the strange drama of my
      life, always teeming with mysteries, seemed to culminate in this reception
      in an unknown land by people who appeared almost to know more about my
      business than I myself did. I gazed out of the window blankly. In some
      vague dim way I saw we were passing between rocky hills, pine-clad and
      beautiful, with deep glimpses now and then into the riven gorge of a noble
      river. But I didn&rsquo;t even realise to myself that these were Canadian
      hills&mdash;those were the heights of Abraham&mdash;that was the silver
      St. Lawrence. It all passed by like a living dream. I sat still in my
      chair, as one stunned and faint; I gazed out, more dead than alive, on the
      unfamiliar scene that unrolled itself in exquisite panorama before me.
      Quebec and the Laurentian hills were to me half unreal: the inner senses
      alone were awake and conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a gentle voice at my side broke, not at all unpleasantly, the
      current of my reflections. It was a lady&rsquo;s voice, very sweet and
      musical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; it said kindly, with an air of tender
      solicitude, &ldquo;you only just caught the train, and were hurried and
      worried and flurried at the last at the station. You look so white and
      tired. How your breath comes and goes! And I think you&rsquo;re new to our
      Canadian ways. I saw you didn&rsquo;t understand about the checks for the
      baggage. Let me take away this bag and put it up in the rack for you. Here&rsquo;s
      a footstool for your feet; that&rsquo;ll make you more comfortable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first sound of her sweet voice, I turned to look at the speaker.
      She was a girl, perhaps a year or two younger than myself, very slender
      and graceful, and with eyes like a mother&rsquo;s. She wasn&rsquo;t
      exactly pretty, but her face was so full of intelligence and expression
      that it was worth a great deal more than any doll-like prettiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was pleasure at being spoken to kindly at all in this land of
      strangers; perhaps it was revulsion from the agony of shame and modesty I
      had endured at Quebec; but, at any rate, I felt drawn at first sight to my
      sweet-voiced fellow-traveller. Besides, she reminded me somewhat of Minnie
      Moore, and that resemblance alone was enough to attract me. I looked up at
      her gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you so much!&rdquo; I cried, putting my bag in her hand.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only just come out from England; and I&rsquo;d hardly
      time at Quebec to catch the train; and the people crowded around so, that
      I was flustered at landing; and everything somehow seems to be going
      against me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that my poor overwrought nerves gave way all at once, and without
      any more ado I just burst out crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady by my side leant over me tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;cry, dear,&rdquo; she said, as if she&rsquo;d known me
      for years, stooping down and almost caressing me. &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo;&mdash;and
      she turned to a tall gentleman at her side,&mdash;&ldquo;quick! you&rsquo;ve
      got my black bag; get me out the sal volatile. She&rsquo;s quite faint,
      poor thing; we must look after her instantly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The person to whom she spoke, and who was apparently her husband or her
      brother, took down the black bag from the rack hastily, and got out the
      sal volatile, as my friend directed him. He poured a little into a tumbler
      and held it quietly to my lips. I liked his manner, as I&rsquo;d liked the
      lady&rsquo;s. He was so very brotherly. Besides, there was something
      extremely soothing about his quick, noiseless way. He did it all so fast,
      yet without the faintest sign of agitation. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking
      what a good nurse he would make; he was so rapid and effective, yet so
      gentle and so quiet. He seemed perfectly accustomed to the ways of nervous
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dried my eyes after a while, and looked up in his face. He was very
      good-looking, and had a charming soft smile. How lucky I should have
      tumbled upon such pleasant travelling companions! In my present mental
      state, I had need of sympathy. And, indeed, they took as much care of me,
      and coddled me up as tenderly, as if they&rsquo;d known me for years. I
      was almost tempted to make a clean breast of my personality to them, and
      tell them why it was I had been so worried and upset by my reception at
      Quebec: but I shrank from confessing it. I hated my own name, almost, it
      seemed to bring me such very unpleasant notoriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a very few minutes, I felt quite at home with my new friends. I
      explained to them that when I landed I had no intention of going on West
      by train at once, but that news which I received on the way had compelled
      me to push forward by the very first chance; and that I had to change my
      ticket at a place called Sharbot Lake, whose very position or distance I
      hadn&rsquo;t had time to discover. The lady smiled sweetly, and calmed my
      fears by telling me we wouldn&rsquo;t reach Sharbot Lake till mid-day
      to-morrow, and that I would have plenty of time there to book on to my
      destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, I went on to tell them I had no Canadian money, having
      brought out what I needed for travelling expenses and hotels in Bank of
      England 20 pound notes. The lady smiled again, and said in the friendliest
      way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my brother&rsquo;ll get them changed for you at Montreal as we
      pass, won&rsquo;t you, Jack? or at least as much as you need till you get
      to&rdquo;&mdash;she checked herself&mdash;&ldquo;the end of your journey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed how she pulled herself up, though at the moment I attached no
      particular importance to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was her brother, not her husband, then! Well, he was a very nice
      fellow, either way, and nobody could be kinder or more sympathetic than he&rsquo;d
      been to me so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      We fell into conversation, which soon by degrees grew quite intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far West are you going?&rdquo; the man she called Jack asked
      after a little time, tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I answered, all unsuspiciously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a place called Palmyra.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we live not far from Palmyra,&rdquo; the sister replied, with
      a smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going that way now. Our station&rsquo;s
      Adolphus Town, the very next village.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I hadn&rsquo;t yet learned to join the wisdom of the serpent to the
      innocence of the dove, I&rsquo;m afraid. Remember, though in some ways I
      was a woman full grown, in others I was little more than a four-year-old
      baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know a Dr. Ivor there?&rdquo; I asked eagerly, leaning
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, quite well,&rdquo; the lady answered, arranging my
      footstool more comfortably as she spoke. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a farm out
      there now, and hardly practises at all. How queer it is! One always finds
      one knows people in common. Is Dr. Ivor a friend of yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I recoiled at the stray question almost as if I&rsquo;d been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; I cried, horrified at the bare idea of such treason.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s anything but a friend... I&mdash;I only wanted to know
      about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady looked at Jack, and Jack looked at the lady. Were they
      telegraphing signs? I fancied somehow they gave one another very meaning
      glances. Jack was the first to speak, breaking an awkward silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect everyone to know your own friends, or to
      like them either, Elsie,&rdquo; he said slowly, with his eyes fixed hard
      on her, as if he expected her to flare up.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart misgave me. A hateful idea arose in it. Could my sweet travelling
      companion be engaged&mdash;to my father&rsquo;s murderer?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a dear good fellow, for all that, Jack,&rdquo; Elsie
      said stoutly; and strange as it sounds to say so, I admired her for
      sticking up for her friend Dr. Ivor, if she really liked him. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      hear him run down by anybody, not even by YOU. If this lady knew him
      better, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d like him, as we all do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack turned the conversation abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re going to Palmyra,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;where
      do you mean to stop? Have you thought about lodgings? You mustn&rsquo;t
      imagine it&rsquo;s a place like an English town, with an inn or hotel or
      good private apartments. There&rsquo;s nowhere you can put up at in these
      brand-new villages. Are you going to friends, or did you expect to find
      quarters as easily as in England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a difficulty which, indeed, had never even occurred to me till
      that moment. I stammered and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;to tell you the truth, I haven&rsquo;t
      thought about that. The landing at Quebec was such a dreadful surprise to
      me, and&rdquo;&mdash;tears came into my eyes again&mdash;&ldquo;I had a
      great shock there&mdash;and I had to come on so quick, I didn&rsquo;t ask
      about anything but catching the train. I meant to stop a night or two
      either at Quebec or in Montreal, and to make all inquiries: but
      circumstances, you see, have prevented that. So I really don&rsquo;t know
      what I&rsquo;d better do when I get to Palmyra.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; my new friend answered quickly, her soft sweet voice
      having quite a decisive ring in it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not go on to
      Palmyra at all. There&rsquo;s no sort of accommodation there, except a
      horrid drinking-saloon. You&rsquo;d better stop short at Adolphus Town and
      spend the night with us; and then you can look about you next day, if you
      like, and see what chance there may be of finding decent quarters. Old
      Mrs. Wilkins might take her in, Jack, or the Blacks at the tannery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, and felt touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how good of you!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;But I really couldn&rsquo;t
      think of it. Thank you ever so much, though, for your kind thought, all
      the same. It&rsquo;s so good and sweet of you. But you don&rsquo;t even
      know who I am. I have no introduction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re your own best introduction,&rdquo; Elsie said, with a
      pretty nod: I thought of her somehow from the very first moment I heard
      her name as Elsie. &ldquo;And as to your not knowing us, never mind about
      that. We know YOU at first sight. It&rsquo;s the Canadian way to entertain
      Angels unawares. Out here, you know, hospitality&rsquo;s the rule of the
      country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I demurred for a long time; I fought off their invitation as well as
      I could: I couldn&rsquo;t bear thus to quarter myself upon utter
      strangers. But they both were so pressing, and brought up so many cogent
      arguments why I couldn&rsquo;t go alone to the one village saloon&mdash;a
      mere whisky-drinking public-house, they said, of very bad character,&mdash;that
      in the long run I was fain almost to acquiesce in their kind plan for my
      temporary housing. Besides, after my horrid experience at Quebec, it was
      such a positive relief to me to meet anybody nice and delicate, that I
      couldn&rsquo;t find it in my heart to refuse these dear people. And then,
      perhaps it was best not to go quite on to Palmyra at once, for fear of
      unexpectedly running against my father&rsquo;s murderer. If I met him in
      the street, and he recognised me and spoke to me, what on earth could I
      do? My head was all in a whirl, indeed, as to what he might intend or
      expect: for I felt sure he expected me. I made one last despairing effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I stop at your house, though,&rdquo; I said, half ashamed of
      myself for venturing to make conditions, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one promise
      you must make me&mdash;that I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see Dr. Ivor unless you
      let me know and get my consent beforehand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, as I called him to myself, answered gaily back with a rather curious
      smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like, you need see nobody but our own two selves. We&rsquo;ll
      promise not to introduce anybody to you without due leave, and to let you
      do as you like in that and in everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I yielded at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must know your name,&rdquo; I said tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jack, looking queerly at me with an inquiring air, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s Elsie; mine&rsquo;s John Cheriton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yours?&rdquo; Elsie asked, glancing timidly down at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart beat hard. I was face to face with a dilemma. These were friends
      of Courtenay Ivor&rsquo;s, and I had given myself away to them. I was
      going to their house, to accept their hospitality&mdash;and to betray
      their friend! Never in my life did I feel so guilty before. Oh! what on
      earth was I to do? I had told them too much; I had gone to work foolishly.
      If I said my real name, I should let out my whole secret. I must brazen it
      out now. With tremulous lips and flushed cheek, I answered quickly,
      &ldquo;Julia Marsden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie drew back, all abashed. In a moment her cheek grew still redder, I
      felt sure, than my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marsden!&rdquo; she cried, eyeing me close. &ldquo;Why, I
      thought you were Miss Callingham!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth did you know that?&rdquo; I exclaimed, terrified
      almost out of my life. Was I never for one moment to escape my own
      personality?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they put it in the papers that you were coming,&rdquo; Elsie
      answered, looking tenderly at me, more in sympathy than in anger. &ldquo;And
      it&rsquo;s written on your bag, you know, that Jack put up in the rack
      there... That&rsquo;s why we were so sorry for you, and so grieved at the
      way you must have been hustled on the quay. And that&rsquo;s also why we
      wanted you to come to us... But don&rsquo;t be a bit afraid. We quite
      understand you want to travel incognita. After the sort of reception you
      got at Quebec, no wonder you&rsquo;re afraid of these hateful
      sightseers!... Very well, dear,&rdquo; she took my hand with the air of an
      old friend, &ldquo;your disguise shall be respected while you stop at our
      house. Miss Marsden let it be. You can make any inquiries you like about
      Dr. Ivor. We will be secrecy itself. We&rsquo;ll say nothing to anyone.
      And my brother&rsquo;ll take your ticket at Sharbot Lake for Adolphus
      Town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I broke down once more. I fairly cried at such kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how good you are!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;How very, very good.
      This is more than one could ever have expected from strangers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She held my hand and stroked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not strangers,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      English ourselves. We sympathise deeply with you in this new, strange
      country. You must treat us exactly like a brother and sister. We liked you
      at first sight, and we&rsquo;re sure we&rsquo;ll get on with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I lifted her hand to my lips and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I liked you also,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and your brother, too.
      You&rsquo;re both so good and kind. How can I ever sufficiently thank you?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; MY PLANS ALTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rest of that day we spent chatting very amicably in our Pullman
      arm-chairs. I couldn&rsquo;t understand it myself&mdash;when I had a
      moment to think, I was shocked and horrified at it. I was so terribly at
      home with them. These were friends of Dr. Ivor&rsquo;s&mdash;friends of my
      father&rsquo;s murderer! I had come out to Canada to track him, to deliver
      him over, if I could, to the strong hand of Justice. And yet, there I was
      talking away with his neighbours and friends as if I had known them all my
      life, and loved them dearly. Nay, what was more, I couldn&rsquo;t in my
      heart of hearts help liking them. They were really sweet people&mdash;so
      kind and sympathetic, so perceptive of my sensitiveness. They asked no
      questions that could hurt me in any way. They showed no curiosity about
      the object of my visit or my relation to Dr. Ivor. They were kindness and
      courtesy itself. I could see Mr. Cheriton was a gentleman in fibre, and
      Elsie was as sweet as any woman on earth could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, the time came for the Pullman saloon to be transformed for the
      night into a regular sleeping-car. All this was new to me, and I watched
      it with interest. As soon as the beds were made up, I crept into my berth,
      and my new friend Elsie took her place on the sofa below me. I lay awake
      long and thought over the situation. The more I thought of it, the
      stranger it all seemed. I tried hard to persuade myself I was running some
      great danger in accepting the Cheritons&rsquo; invitation. Certainly, I
      had behaved with consummate imprudence. Canada is a country, I said to
      myself, where they kidnap and murder well-to-do young Englishmen. How much
      easier, then, to kidnap and murder a poor weak stray English girl! I was
      entirely at the mercy of the Cheritons, that was clear: and the Cheritons
      were Dr. Ivor&rsquo;s friends. As I thought all the circumstances over,
      the full folly of my own conduct came home to me more and more. I had let
      these people suppose I was travelling under an assumed name. I had let
      them know my ticket was not for Palmyra but for Kingston, where I didn&rsquo;t
      mean to go. I had told them I meant to change it at Sharbot Lake. So they
      were aware that no one on earth but themselves had any idea where I had
      gone. And I had further divulged to them the important fact that I had
      plenty of ready money in Bank of England notes! I stood aghast at my own
      silliness. But still, I did NOT distrust them.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I did NOT distrust them. I felt I ought to be distrustful. I felt it
      might be expected of me. But they were so gentle-mannered and so
      sweet-natured, that I couldn&rsquo;t distrust them. I tried very hard, but
      distrust wouldn&rsquo;t come to me. That kind fellow Jack&mdash;I thought
      of him, just so, as Jack already&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly, much
      less kill a woman. It grieved me to think I would have to hurt his
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now that I came to look things squarely in the face in my berth by
      myself, I began to see how utterly impossible it would be for me after all
      to go and stop with the Cheritons. How I could ever have dreamt it
      feasible I could hardly conceive. I ought to have refused at once. I ought
      to have been braver. I ought to have said outright, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
      nothing to do or say with anyone who is a friend or an acquaintance of
      Courtenay Ivor&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And yet, to have said so would have been to
      give up the game for lost. It would have been to proclaim that I had come
      out to Canada as Courtenay Ivor&rsquo;s enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wasn&rsquo;t fit, that was the fact, for my self-imposed task of private
      detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good part of that night I lay awake in my berth, bitterly reproaching
      myself for having come on this wild-goose chase without the aid of a man&mdash;an
      experienced officer. Next morning, I rose and breakfasted in the car. The
      Cheritons breakfasted with me, and, sad to say, seemed more charming than
      ever. That good fellow Jack was so attentive and kind, I almost felt
      ashamed to have to refuse his hospitality; and as for Elsie, she couldn&rsquo;t
      have treated me more nicely or cordially if she&rsquo;d been my own
      sister. It wasn&rsquo;t what they said that touched my heart: it was what
      they didn&rsquo;t say or do&mdash;their sweet, generous reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast, I steeled myself for the task, and broke it to them
      gently that, thinking it over in the night, I&rsquo;d come to the
      conclusion I couldn&rsquo;t consistently accept their proffered welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to say NO to you,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;after
      you&rsquo;ve been so wonderfully kind and nice; but reasons which I can&rsquo;t
      fully explain just now make me feel it would be wrong of me to think of
      stopping with you. It would hamper my independence of action to be in
      anybody else&rsquo;s house. I must shift for myself, and try if I can&rsquo;t
      find board and lodging somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find it with us then!&rdquo; Elsie put in eagerly. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s
      all that&rsquo;s the matter, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re not proud&mdash;are
      we, Jack?&mdash;not a bit. Sooner than you should go elsewhere and be
      uncomfortable in your rooms, I&rsquo;d take you in myself, and board you
      and look after you. You could pay what you like; and then you&rsquo;d
      retain your independence, you see, as much as ever you wanted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But her brother interrupted her with a somewhat graver air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes deeper than that, I&rsquo;m afraid, Elsie,&rdquo; he said,
      turning his eye full upon her. &ldquo;If Miss Callingham feels she couldn&rsquo;t
      be happy in stopping with us, she&rsquo;d better try elsewhere. Though
      where on earth we can put her, I haven&rsquo;t just now the very slightest
      idea. But we&rsquo;ll turn it over in our own minds before we reach
      Adolphus Town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sweet reasonableness about Jack that attracted me greatly. I
      could see he entered vaguely into the real nature of my feelings. But he
      wouldn&rsquo;t cross-question me: he was too much of a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Callingham knows her own motives best,&rdquo; he said more
      than once, when Elsie tried to return to the charge. &ldquo;If she feels
      she can&rsquo;t come to us, we must be content to do the best we can for
      her with our neighbours. Perhaps Mrs. Walters would take her in: she&rsquo;s
      our clergyman&rsquo;s wife, Miss Callingham, and you mightn&rsquo;t feel
      the same awkwardness with her as with my sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know&mdash;Dr. Ivor?&rdquo; I faltered out, unable to
      conceal my real reasons entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so intimately as we do,&rdquo; Jack answered, with a quick
      glance at his sister. &ldquo;We might ask her at any rate. There are so
      few houses in Palmyra or the neighbourhood where you could live as you&rsquo;re
      accustomed, that we mustn&rsquo;t be particular. But at least you&rsquo;ll
      spend one night with us, and then we can arrange all the other things
      afterward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My mind was made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not even one night,&rdquo; I said. I couldn&rsquo;t accept
      hospitality from Dr. Ivor&rsquo;s friends. Between his faction and mine
      there could be nothing now but the bitterest enmity. How dare I even
      parley with people who were friends of my father&rsquo;s murderer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I was sorry to disappoint that good fellow, Jack, all the same. Did he
      want me to sleep one night at his house on purpose to rob me and murder
      me? Girl as I was, and rendered timorous in some ways by the terrible
      shocks I had received, I couldn&rsquo;t for one moment believe it. I KNEW
      he was good: I KNEW he was honourable, gentle, a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, journeying on all morning, we reached Sharbot Lake, still with nothing
      decided. At the little junction station, Jack got me my ticket. That was
      the turning point in my career. The die was cast. There I lost my
      identity. A crowd lounged around the platform, and surged about the
      Pullman car, calling to see &ldquo;Una Callingham.&rdquo; But no Una
      Callingham appeared on the scene. I went, on in the same train, without a
      word to anyone, all unknown save to the two Cheritons, and as an
      unrecognised unit of common humanity. I had cast that horrid identity
      clean behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was pleasant. In spite of my uncertainty, it gave me a sense
      of pleased confidence to be in the Cheritons&rsquo; company. I had taken
      to them at once: and the more I talked with them, the better I liked them.
      Especially Jack, that nice brotherly Jack, who seemed almost like an old
      friend to me. You get to know people so well on a long railway journey. I
      was quite sorry to think that by five o&rsquo;clock that afternoon we
      should reach Adolphus Town, and so part company.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten minutes to five, we were collecting our scattered things, and
      putting our front-hair straight by the mirror in the ladies&rsquo;
      compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Cheriton,&rdquo; I said warmly, longing to kiss her as I
      spoke, &ldquo;I shall never forget how kind you two have been to me. I do
      wish so much I hadn&rsquo;t to leave you like this. But it&rsquo;s quite
      inevitable. I don&rsquo;t see really how I could ever endure&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I said no more, for just at that moment, as the words trembled on my lips,
      a terrible jar thrilled suddenly through the length and breadth of the
      carriage. Something in front seemed to rush into us with a deep thud.
      There was a crash, a fierce grating, a dull hiss, a clatter. Broken glass
      was flying about. The very earth beneath the wheels seemed to give way
      under us. Next instant, all was blank. I just knew I was lying, bruised
      and stunned and bleeding, on a bare dry bank, with my limbs aching
      painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guessed what it all meant. A collision, no doubt. But I lay faint and
      ill, and knew nothing for the moment as to what had become of my
      fellow-passengers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; A STRANGE RECOGNITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gradually I was aware of somebody moistening my temples. A soft palm held
      my hand. Elsie was leaning over me. I opened my eyes with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Elsie,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;how kind of you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me quite natural to call her Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as I spoke, somebody else raised my head and poured something down my
      throat. I swallowed it with a gulp. Then I opened my eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jack, too,&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if he&rsquo;d been &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; to me for years and
      years already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows us!&rdquo; Elsie cried, clasping her hands. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      much better&mdash;much better. Quick, Jack, more brandy! And make haste
      there&mdash;a stretcher!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a noise close by. Unseen hands lifted me up, and Jack laid me on
      the stretcher. Half-an-hour at least must have elapsed, I felt since the
      first shock of the accident. I had been unconscious meanwhile. The actual
      crash came and went like lightning. And my memory of all else was blotted
      out for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, as I lay still, two men took the stretcher and carried me off at a
      slow pace, under Jack&rsquo;s direction. They walked single-file along the
      line, and turned down a rough road that led off near a river. I didn&rsquo;t
      ask where they were going: I was too weak and feeble. At last they came to
      a house, a small white wooden cottage, very colonial and simple, but neat
      and pretty. There was a garden in front, full of old-fashioned flowering
      shrubs; and a verandah ran round the house, about whose posts clambered
      sweet English creepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried me in, and laid me down on a bed, in a sweet little room,
      very plain but dainty. It was panelled with polished pitchpine, and roses
      peeped in at the open window. Everything about the cottage bore the
      impress of native good taste. I knew it was Jack&rsquo;s home. It was just
      such a room as I should have expected from Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bed on which they placed me was neat and soft. I lay there dozing with
      pain. Elsie sat by my side, her own arm in a sling. By-and-by, an Irish
      maid came in and undressed me carefully under Elsie&rsquo;s direction.
      Then Elsie said to me, half shrinking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you must see the doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Dr. Ivor!&rdquo; I cried, waking up to a full sense of this new
      threatened horror. &ldquo;Whatever I do, dear, I WON&rsquo;T see Dr. Ivor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack had come in while she spoke, and was standing by the bed, I saw now.
      The servant had gone out. He lifted my arm, and held my wrist in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a doctor myself, Miss Callingham,&rdquo; he said softly,
      with that quiet, reassuring voice of his. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed at
      that; nobody but myself and Elsie need come near you in any way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled at his words, well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re a doctor!&rdquo; I cried, much
      relieved at the news; &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m not the least little bit in the
      world afraid of YOU. I don&rsquo;t mind your attending me. I like to have
      you with me.&rdquo; For I had always a great fancy for doctors, somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; he said, smiling at me such a sweet
      sympathetic smile as he felt my pulse with his finger. &ldquo;Confidence
      is the first great requisite in a patient: it&rsquo;s half the battle. You&rsquo;re
      not seriously hurt, I hope, but you&rsquo;re very much shaken. Whether you
      like it or not, you&rsquo;ll have to stop here now for some days at least,
      till you&rsquo;re thoroughly recovered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m ashamed to write it down; but I was really pleased to hear it.
      Nothing would have induced me to go voluntarily to their house with the
      intention of stopping there&mdash;for they were friends of Dr. Ivor&rsquo;s.
      But when you&rsquo;re carried on a stretcher to the nearest convenient
      house, you&rsquo;re not responsible for your own actions. And they were
      both so nice and kind, it was a pleasure to be near them. So I was almost
      thankful for that horrid accident, which had cut the Gordian knot of my
      perplexity as to a house to lodge in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fortnight before I was well enough to get out of bed and lie
      comfortably on the sofa. All that time Jack and Elsie tended me with
      unsparing devotion. Elsie had a little bed made up in my room; and Jack
      came to see me two or three times a day, and sat for whole hours with me.
      It was so nice he was a doctor! A doctor, you know, isn&rsquo;t a man&mdash;in
      some ways. And it soothed me so to have him sitting there with Elsie by my
      bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elsie&rdquo; to me, to their
      faces, before three days were out; and I was plain &ldquo;Una&rdquo; to
      them: it sounded so sweet and sisterly. Elsie slipped it out the second
      morning as naturally as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una&rsquo;d like a cup of tea, Jack;&rdquo; then as red as fire all
      at once, she corrected herself, and added, &ldquo;I mean, Miss Callingham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do call me Una!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so much nicer
      and more natural.... But how did you come to know my name was Una at all?&rdquo;
      For she slipped it out as glibly as if she&rsquo;d always called me so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, everybody knows that.&rdquo; Elsie answered, amused. &ldquo;The
      whole world speaks of you always as Una Callingham. You forget you&rsquo;re
      a celebrity. Doctors have read memoirs about you at Medical Congresses.
      You&rsquo;ve been discussed in every paper in Europe and America.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused and sighed. This was very humiliating. It was unpleasant to rank
      in the public mind somewhere between Constance Kent and Laura Bridgman.
      But I had to put up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, with a deep breath, &ldquo;if those I don&rsquo;t
      care for call me so behind my back, let me at least have the pleasure of
      hearing myself called so by those I love, like you, Elsie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leant over me and kissed my forehead with a burst of genuine delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you love me, Una!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it?&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I love you dearly
      already.&rdquo; And I might have added with truth, &ldquo;And your brother
      also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Jack was really, without any exception, the most lovable man I ever
      met in my life&mdash;at once so strong and manly, and yet so womanly and
      so gentle. Every day I stopped there, I liked him better and better. I was
      glad when he came into my room, and sorry when he went away again to work
      on the farm: for he worked very hard; his hand was all horny with common
      agricultural labour. It was sad to think of such a man having to do such
      work. And yet he was so clever, and such a capital doctor. I wondered he
      hadn&rsquo;t done well and stayed in England. But Elsie told me he&rsquo;d
      had great disappointments, and failed in his profession through no fault
      of his own. I could never understand that: he had such a delightful
      manner. Though, perhaps I was prejudiced; for, in point of fact, I began
      to feel I was really in love with Jack Cheriton.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jack was in love with me too. This was a curious result of my voyage
      to Canada in search of Dr. Ivor! Instead of hunting up the criminal, I had
      stopped to fall in love with one of his friends and neighbours. And I
      found it so delicious: I won&rsquo;t pretend to deny it. I was absolutely
      happy when Jack sat by my bedside and held my hand in his. I didn&rsquo;t
      know what it would lead to, or whether it would ever lead to anything at
      all; but I was happy meanwhile just to love and be loved by him. I think
      when you&rsquo;re really in love, that&rsquo;s quite enough. Jack never
      proposed to me: he never asked me to marry him. He just sat by my bedside
      and held my hand; and once, when Elsie went out to fetch my beef-tea, he
      stooped hastily down and kissed, me, oh, so tenderly! I don&rsquo;t know
      why, but I wasn&rsquo;t the least surprised. It seemed to me quite natural
      that Jack should kiss me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I went idly on for a fortnight, in a sort of lazy lotus-land, never
      thinking of the future, but as happy and as much at home as if I&rsquo;d
      lived all my life with Jack and Elsie. I hated even to think I would soon
      be well; for then I&rsquo;d have to go and look out for Courtenay Ivor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last one afternoon I was sufficiently strong to be lifted out of bed,
      and dressed in a morning robe, and laid out on the sofa in the little
      drawing-room. It looked out upon the verandah, which was high above the
      ground; and Jack came in and sat with me, alone without Elsie. My heart
      throbbed high at that: I liked to be alone for half-an-hour with Jack.
      Perhaps... But who knows? Well, at any rate, even if he didn&rsquo;t, it
      was nice to have the chance of a good long, quiet chat with him. I loved
      Elsie dearly; but at a moment like this, why, I liked to have Jack all to
      myself without even Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was pleased when Jack told me Elsie was going into Palmyra with the
      buggy to get the English letters. Then she&rsquo;d be gone a good long
      time! Oh, how lovely! How beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything you&rsquo;d like from the town?&rdquo; he asked,
      as Elsie drove past the window. &ldquo;Anything Elsie could get for you?
      If so, please say so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; I asked at last, for I didn&rsquo;t want to be
      troublesome, &ldquo;she could get me a lemon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; Jack answered; &ldquo;there she goes in the
      buggy! Here, wait a moment, Una! I&rsquo;ll run after her to the gate this
      minute and tell her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang lightly on to the parapet of the verandah. Then, with one hand
      held behind him to poise himself, palm open backward, he leapt with a
      bound to the road, and darted after her hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart stood still within me. That action revealed him. The back, the
      open hand, the gesture, the bend&mdash;I would have known them anywhere.
      With a horrible revulsion I recognised the truth. This was my father&rsquo;s
      murderer! This was Courtenay Ivor!

      CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; MURDER WILL OUT
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was gone but for three minutes. Meanwhile, I buried my face in my
      burning hands, and cried to myself in unspeakable misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, horrible as it sounds to say so, I knew perfectly well now that Jack
      was Dr. Ivor: yet, in spite of that knowledge, I loved him still. He was
      my father&rsquo;s murderer; and I couldn&rsquo;t help loving him!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that that filled up the cup of my misery to overflowing. I loved
      the man well: and I must turn to denounce him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back, flushed and hot, expecting thanks for his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;ll get you the lemon, Una,&rdquo; he said, panting.
      &ldquo;I overtook her by the big tulip-tree.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed at him fixedly, taking my hands from my face, with the tears still
      wet on my burning cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve deceived me!&rdquo; I cried sternly. &ldquo;Jack, you&rsquo;ve
      given me a false name. I know who you are, now. You&rsquo;re no Jack at
      all. You&rsquo;re Courtenay Ivor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back, quite amazed. Yet he didn&rsquo;t seem thunderstruck. Not
      fear but surprise was the leading note on his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve found that out at last, Una!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      staring hard at me. &ldquo;Then you remember me after all, darling! You
      know who I am. You haven&rsquo;t quite forgotten me. And you recall what
      has gone, do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose from the sofa, ill as I was, in my horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare to speak to me like that, sir!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You,
      whom I&rsquo;ve tracked out to your hiding-place and discovered! You, whom
      I&rsquo;ve come across the ocean to hunt down! You, whom I mean to give up
      this very day to Justice! Let me go from your house at once! How dare you
      ever bring me here? How dare you stand unabashed before the daughter of
      the man you so cruelly murdered?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back like one stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daughter of the man I murdered!&rdquo; he faltered out slowly,
      as in a turmoil of astonishment. &ldquo;The man <i>I</i> murdered! Oh,
      Una, is it possible you&rsquo;ve forgotten so much, and yet remember me
      myself? I can&rsquo;t believe it, darling. Sit down, my child, and think.
      Surely, surely the rest will come back to you gradually.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His calmness unnerved me. What could he mean by these words? No actor on
      earth could dissemble like this. His whole manner was utterly unlike the
      manner of a man just detected in a terrible crime. He seemed rather to
      reproach me, indeed, than to crouch; to be shocked and indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself,&rdquo; I said coldly, in a very chilly voice.
      &ldquo;Courtenay Ivor, I give you three minutes to explain. At the end of
      that time, if you can&rsquo;t exonerate yourself, I walk out of this house
      to give you up, as I ought, to the arm of Justice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me, all pity, yet inexpressibly reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Una,&rdquo; he cried, clasping his hands&mdash;those small
      white hands of his&mdash;Aunt Emma&rsquo;s hands&mdash;the murderer&rsquo;s
      hands&mdash;how had I never before noticed them?&mdash;&ldquo;and I, who
      have suffered so much for you! I, who have wrecked my whole life for you,
      ungrudgingly, willingly! I, who have sacrificed even Elsie&rsquo;s
      happiness and Elsie&rsquo;s future for you! This is too, too hard! Una,
      Una, spare me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange trembling seized me. It was in my heart to rush forward and
      clasp him to my breast. Murderer or no murderer, his look, his voice, cut
      me sharply to the heart. Words trembled on the tip of my tongue: &ldquo;Oh,
      Jack, I love you!&rdquo; But with a violent effort, I repressed them
      sternly. This horrible revulsion seemed to tear me in two. I loved him so
      much. Though till the moment of the discovery, I never quite realised how
      deeply I loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courtenay Ivor,&rdquo; I said slowly, steeling myself once more for
      a hard effort, &ldquo;I knew who you were at once when I saw you poise
      yourself on the parapet. Once before in my life I saw you like that, and
      the picture it produced has burned itself into the very fibre and marrow
      of my being. As long as I live, I can never get rid of it. It was when you
      leapt from the window at The Grange, at Woodbury, after murdering my
      father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; he said solemnly, in a very clear voice, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      some terrible error somewhere. You&rsquo;re utterly mistaken about what
      took place that night. But oh, great heavens! how am I ever to explain the
      misconception to YOU? If you still think thus, it would be cruel to
      undeceive you. I daren&rsquo;t tell you the whole truth. It would kill
      you! It would kill you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew myself up like a pillar of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said, in a hard voice; for I saw he had something
      to say. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind for my heart. Tell me the truth. I can
      stand it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated for a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried huskily. &ldquo;Dear Una, don&rsquo;t
      ask me! Won&rsquo;t you trust me, without? Won&rsquo;t you believe me when
      I tell you, I never did it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I answered with sullen resolution, though
      my eyes belied my words. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t disbelieve the evidence of
      my own senses. I SAW you escape that night. I see you still. I&rsquo;ve
      seen you for years. I KNOW it was you, and you only, who did it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung himself down in a chair, and let his arms drop listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what can I ever do to disillusion you?&rdquo; he cried in
      despair. &ldquo;Oh! what can I ever do? This is too, too terrible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; I said, with a gulp. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      deceived me, Jack. You&rsquo;ve lied to me. You have given me feigned
      names. You have decoyed me to your house under false pretences. And I
      recognise you now. I know you in all your baseness. You&rsquo;re my father&rsquo;s
      murderer! Don&rsquo;t hope to escape by playing on my feelings. I&rsquo;d
      deserve to be murdered myself, if I could act like that! I&rsquo;m on my
      way to the police-office, to give you in custody on the charge of
      murdering Vivian Callingham at Woodbury!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up again, all anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you mustn&rsquo;t walk!&rdquo; he cried, laying his hand
      upon my arm. &ldquo;Give me up, if you like; but wait till the buggy comes
      back, and Elsie&rsquo;ll drive you round with me. You&rsquo;re not fit to
      go a step as you are at present... Oh! what shall I ever do, though. You&rsquo;re
      so weak and ill. Elsie&rsquo;ll never allow it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elsie&rsquo;ll never allow WHAT?&rdquo; I asked; though I felt it
      was rather more grotesque than undignified and inconsistent thus to parley
      and make terms with my father&rsquo;s murderer. Though, to be sure, it was
      Jack, and I couldn&rsquo;t bear to refuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his hand on my arm with an air of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, my child,&rdquo; he said, thrusting me back&mdash;and even at
      that moment of supreme horror, a thrill ran all through my body at his
      touch and his words&mdash;&ldquo;you MUSTN&rsquo;T go out of this house as
      you are this minute. I refuse to allow it. I&rsquo;m your doctor, and I
      forbid it. You&rsquo;re under my charge, and I won&rsquo;t let you stir.
      If I did, I&rsquo;d be responsible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed me gently into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you but one false name,&rdquo; he said slowly&mdash;&ldquo;the
      name of Cheriton. To be sure I, was never christened John, but I&rsquo;m
      Jack to my intimates. It was my nickname from a baby. Jack&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve
      always been called at home&mdash;Jack&rsquo;s what, in the dear old days
      at Torquay, you always called me. But I saw if I let you know who I was at
      once, there&rsquo;d be no chance of recalling the past, and so saving you
      from yourself. To save you, I consented to that one mild deception. It
      succeeded in bringing you here, and in keeping you here till Elsie and I
      were once more what we&rsquo;d always been to you. I meant to tell you all
      in the end, when the right time came. Now, you&rsquo;ve forced my hand,
      and I don&rsquo;t know how I can any longer refrain from telling you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telling me WHAT?&rdquo; I said icily. &ldquo;What do you mean by
      your words? Why all these dark hints? If you&rsquo;ve anything to say, why
      not say it like a man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For I loved him so much that in my heart of hearts, I half hoped there
      might still be some excuse, some explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me solemnly. Then he leant back in his chair and drew his
      hand across his brow. I could see now why I hadn&rsquo;t recognised that
      delicate hand before: white as it was by nature, hard work on the farm had
      long bronzed and distorted it. But I saw also, for the first time, that
      the palm was scarred with cuts and rents&mdash;exactly like Minnie Moore&rsquo;s,
      exactly like Aunt Emma&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una,&rdquo; he began slowly, in a very puzzled tone, &ldquo;if I
      could, I&rsquo;d give myself up and be tried, and be found guilty and
      executed for your sake, sooner than cause you any further distress, or
      expose you to the shock of any more disclosures. But I can&rsquo;t do
      that, on Elsie&rsquo;s account. Even if I decided to put Elsie to that
      shame and disgrace&mdash;which would hardly be just, which would hardly be
      manly of me&mdash;Elsie knows all, and Elsie&rsquo;d never consent to it.
      She&rsquo;d never let her brother be hanged for a crime of which (as she
      knows) he&rsquo;s entirely innocent. And she&rsquo;d tell out all in full
      court&mdash;every fact, every detail&mdash;which would be worse for you
      ten thousand times in the end than learning it here quietly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all,&rdquo; I said, growing stony, yet trembling from head
      to foot. &ldquo;Oh, Jack,&rdquo;&mdash;I seized his hand,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know what you mean! But I somehow trust you. I want to know
      all. I can bear anything&mdash;anything&mdash;better than this suspense.
      You MUST tell me! You MUST explain to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said slowly, looking hard into my eyes, and
      feeling my pulse half unconsciously with his finger as he spoke. &ldquo;Una
      darling, you must make up your mind now for a terrible shock. I won&rsquo;t
      tell you in words, for you&rsquo;d never believe it. I&rsquo;ll SHOW you
      who it was that fired the shot at Mr. Callingham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved over to the other side of the room, and unlocking drawer after
      drawer, took a bundle of photographs from the inmost secret cabinet of a
      desk in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Una,&rdquo; he said, selecting one of them and holding it up
      before my eyes. &ldquo;Prepare yourself, darling. That&rsquo;s the person
      who pulled the trigger that night in the library!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at it and fell back with a deadly shriek of horror. It was an
      instantaneous photograph. It represented a scene just before the one the
      Inspector gave me. And there, in its midst, I saw myself as a girl, with a
      pistol in my hand. The muzzle flashed and smoked. I knew the whole truth.
      It was I myself who held the pistol and fired at my father!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; THE REAL MURDERER
    </h2>
    <p>
      For some seconds I sat there, leaning back in my chair and gazing close at
      that incredible, that accusing document. I knew it couldn&rsquo;t lie: I
      knew it must be the very handiwork of unerring Nature. Then slowly a
      recollection began to grow up in my mind. I knew of my own memory it was
      really true. I remembered it so, now, as in a glass, darkly. I remembered
      having stood, with the pistol in my hand, pointing it straight at the
      breast of the man with the long white beard whom they called my father. A
      new mental picture rose up before me like a vision. I remembered it all as
      something that once really occurred to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I remembered it, as I had long remembered the next scene in the
      series, merely as so much isolated and unrelated fact, without connection
      of any sort to link it to the events that preceded or followed it. It was
      <i>I</i> who shot my father! I realised that now with a horrid gulp. But
      what on earth did I ever shoot him for?
    </p>
    <p>
      And I had hunted down Jack for the crime I had committed myself! I had
      threatened to give him up for my own dreadful parricide!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute, I rose, and staggered feebly to the door. I saw the path
      of duty clear as daylight before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Jack faltered out, watching me close
      with anxious eyes, lest I should stumble or faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I answered aloud, in a hollow voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the police-station, of course,&mdash;to give myself into custody
      for the murder of my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When I thought it was Jack, though I loved him better than I loved my own
      life, I would have given him up to justice as a sacred duty. Now I knew it
      was myself, how could I possibly do otherwise? How could I love my own
      life better than I loved dear Jack&rsquo;s, who had given up everything to
      save me and protect me?
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wild bound of horror, Jack sprang upon me at once. He seized me
      bodily in his arms. He carried me back into the room with irresistible
      strength. I fought against him in vain. He laid me on the sofa. He bent
      over me like a whirlwind and smothered me with hot kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my darling, then this shock
      hasn&rsquo;t killed you! It hasn&rsquo;t stunned you like the last! You&rsquo;re
      still your own dear self! You&rsquo;ve still strength to think and plan
      exactly what one would expect from you. Oh! Una, my Una, you must wait and
      hear all. When you&rsquo;ve learned HOW it happened, you won&rsquo;t wish
      to act so rashly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I struggled to free myself, though his arms were hard and close like a
      strong man&rsquo;s around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, Jack!&rdquo; I cried feebly, trying to tear myself from
      his grasp. &ldquo;I love you better than I love my own life. If I would
      have given YOU up, how much more must I give up myself, now I know it was
      I who really did it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He held me down by main force. He pinned me to the sofa. I suppose it&rsquo;s
      because I&rsquo;m a woman, and weak, and all that&mdash;but I liked even
      then to feel how strong and how big he was, and how feeble I was myself,
      like a child in his arms. And I resisted on purpose, just to feel him hold
      me. Somehow, I couldn&rsquo;t realize, after all, that I was indeed a
      murderess. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was
      in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; I said slowly, giving way at last, and letting him
      hold me down with his small strong hands and slender iron wrist, &ldquo;tell
      me, if you will, how I came to do it. I&rsquo;ll sit here quite still, if
      only you&rsquo;ll tell me. Am I really a murderess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack recoiled like one shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU a murderess, my spotless Una!&rdquo; he exclaimed, all aghast.
      &ldquo;If anyone else on earth but you had just asked such a thing in my
      presence, I&rsquo;d have leapt at the fellow&rsquo;s throat, and held him
      down till I choked him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did it!&rdquo; I cried wildly. &ldquo;I remember now, I did
      it. It all comes back to me at last. I fired at him, just so. I aimed the
      loaded pistol point-blank at his heart, I can hear the din in my ears. I
      can see the flash at the muzzle. And then I flung down the pistol&mdash;like
      this&mdash;at my feet: and darkness came on; and I forgot everything. Why,
      Dr. Marten knew that much! I remember now, he told me he&rsquo;d formed a
      very strong impression, from the nature of the wound and the position of
      the various objects on the floor of the room, who it was that did it! He
      must have seen it was <i>I</i> who flung down the pistol.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack gazed at me in suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very good friend of yours, then,&rdquo; he murmured,
      &ldquo;that Dr. Marten. For he never said a word of all that at the
      inquest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must give myself up!&rdquo; I cried, in a fever of penitence
      for what that other woman who once was ME had done. &ldquo;Oh, Jack, do
      let me! It&rsquo;s hateful to know I&rsquo;m a murderess and to go
      unpunished. It&rsquo;s hateful to draw back from the fate I&rsquo;d have
      imposed on another. I&rsquo;d like to be hanged for it. I want to be
      hanged. It&rsquo;s the only possible way to appease one&rsquo;s
      conscience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, though I said it, I felt all the time it wasn&rsquo;t really I,
      but that other strange girl who once lived at The Grange and looked
      exactly like me. I remember it, to be sure; but it was in my Other State:
      and, so far as my moral responsibility was concerned, my Other State and I
      were two different people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For I knew in my heart I couldn&rsquo;t commit a murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack rose without a word, and fetched me in some brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink this,&rdquo; he said calmly, in his authoritative medical
      tone; &ldquo;drink this before you say another sentence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, obedient to his order, I took it up and drank it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down beside me, and took my hand in his, and with very gentle
      words began to reason and argue with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad I&rsquo;d struggled, he said, because that broke the first
      force of the terrible shock for me. Action was always good for one in any
      great crisis. It gave an outlet for the pent-up emotions, too suddenly let
      loose with explosive force, and kept them from turning inward and doing
      serious harm, as mine had done on that horrible night of the accident. He
      called it always the accident, I noticed, and never the murder. That gave
      me fresh hope. Could I really after all have fired unintentionally? But
      no; when I came to look inward,&mdash;to look backward on my past state,&mdash;I
      was conscious all the time of some strong and fierce resentment
      smouldering deep in my heart at the exact moment of firing. However it
      might have happened, I was angry with the man with the long white beard: I
      fired at him hastily, it is true, but with malice prepense and deliberate
      intent to wound and hurt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack went on, however, undeterred, in a low and quiet voice, soothing my
      hand with his as he spoke, and very kind and gentle. My spirit rebelled at
      the thought that I could ever for one moment have imagined him a murderer.
      I said so in one wild burst. Jack held my hand, and still reasoned with
      me. I like a man&rsquo;s reasoning; it&rsquo;s so calm and impartial. It
      seems to overcome one by its mere display of strength. If I&rsquo;d
      changed my mind once, Jack said, I might change it again, when further
      evidence on the point was again forthcoming. I mustn&rsquo;t give myself
      up to the police till I understood much more. If I did, I would commit a
      very grave mistake. There were reasons that had led to the firing of the
      shot. Very grave reasons too. Couldn&rsquo;t I restore and reconstruct
      them, now I knew the last stage of the terrible history? If possible, he&rsquo;d
      rather I should arrive at them by myself than that he should tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cast my mind back all in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jack,&rdquo; I said trustfully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember
      anything one bit like that. I can remember forward, sometimes, but never
      backwards. I can remember now how I flung down the pistol, and how the
      servants burst in. But not a word, not an item, of what went before. That&rsquo;s
      all a pure blank to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I went on to tell him in very brief outline how the first thing I
      could recollect in all my life was the Australian scene with the big
      blue-gum-trees; and how that had been recalled to me by the picture at
      Jane&rsquo;s; and how one scene in that way had gradually suggested
      another; and how I could often think ahead from a given fact but never go
      back behind it and discover what led up to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack drew his hand over his chin and reflected silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; he said, after a pause. &ldquo;Yet very
      comprehensible. I might almost have thought of that before: might have
      arrived at it on general principles. Psychologically and physiologically
      it&rsquo;s exactly what one would have expected from the nature of memory.
      And yet it never occurred to me. Set up the train of thought in the order
      in which it originally presented itself, and the links may readily restore
      themselves in successive series. Try to trace it backward in the inverse
      order, and the process is very much more difficult and involved.&mdash;Well,
      we&rsquo;ll try things just so with you, Una. We&rsquo;ll begin by
      reconstructing your first life as far as we can from the very outset, with
      the aid of these stray hints of yours; and then we&rsquo;ll see whether we
      can get you to remember all your past up to the day of the accident more
      easily.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed up at him with gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jack,&rdquo; I said, trembling, &ldquo;in spite of this shock,
      I believe I can do it now. I believe I can remember. The scales are
      falling from my eyes. I&rsquo;m becoming myself again. What you&rsquo;ve
      said and what you&rsquo;ve shown me seems to have broken down a veil. I
      feel as if I could reconstruct all now, when once the key&rsquo;s
      suggested to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at me encouragingly. Oh, how could I ever have doubted him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, darling,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I should
      have expected as much, indeed. For now for the very first time since the
      accident you&rsquo;ve got really at the other side of the great blank in
      your memory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt so happy, though I knew I was a murderess. I didn&rsquo;t mind now
      whether I was hanged or not. To love Jack and be loved by him was quite
      enough for me. When he called me &ldquo;darling,&rdquo; I was in the
      seventh heavens. It sounded so familiar. I knew he must have called me so,
      often and often before, in the dim dead past that was just beginning to
      recur to me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; THE STRANGER FROM THE SEA
    </h2>
    <p>
      I held his hand tight. It was so pleasant to know I could love him now
      with a clear conscience, even if I had to give myself up to the police
      to-morrow. And indeed, being a woman, I didn&rsquo;t really much care
      whether they took me or not, if only I could love Jack, and know Jack
      loved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell me everything&mdash;this minute&mdash;Jack,&rdquo; I
      said, clinging to him like a child. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear this
      suspense. Begin telling me at once. You&rsquo;ll do me more harm than good
      if you keep me waiting any longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack took instinctively a medical view of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I think, my child,&rdquo; he said, looking lovingly at me.
      &ldquo;Your nerves are on the rack, and will be the better for
      unstringing. Oh, Una, it&rsquo;s such a comfort that you know at last who
      I am! It&rsquo;s such a comfort that I&rsquo;m able to talk to you to-day
      just as we two used to talk four years ago in Devonshire!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I love you then, Jack?&rdquo; I whispered, nestling still
      closer to him, in spite of my horror. Or rather, my very horror made me
      feel more acutely than ever the need for protection. I was no longer alone
      in the world. I had a man to support me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me so, darling,&rdquo; he answered, smoothing my hair with
      his hand. &ldquo;Have you forgotten all about it? Doesn&rsquo;t even that
      come back? Can&rsquo;t you remember it now, when I&rsquo;ve told you who I
      am and how it all happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All cloudy still,&rdquo; I replied, vaguely. &ldquo;Some dim sense
      of familiarity, perhaps,&mdash;as when people say they have a feeling of
      having lived all this over somewhere else before,&mdash;but nothing more
      certain, nothing more definite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must begin at the beginning,&rdquo; Jack answered, bracing
      himself for his hard task, &ldquo;and reconstruct your whole life for you,
      as far as I know it, from your very childhood. I&rsquo;m particularly
      anxious you should not merely be TOLD what took place, but should remember
      the past. There are gaps in my own knowledge I want you to eke out. There
      are places I want you to help me myself over. And besides, it&rsquo;ll be
      more satisfactory to yourself to remember than to be told it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaned back, almost exhausted. Incredible as it may seem to you, in
      spite of that awful photograph, I couldn&rsquo;t really believe even so I
      had killed my father. And yet I knew very well now that Jack, at least,
      hadn&rsquo;t done it. That was almost enough. But not quite. My head swam
      round in terror. I waited and longed for Jack to explain the whole thing
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; he said, watching me close, &ldquo;that when
      you lived as a very little girl in Australia you had a papa who seems
      different to you still from the papa in your later childish memories?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember it very well,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It came back to
      me on the Sarmatian. I think of him always now as the papa in the loose
      white linen coat. The more I dwell on him, the more does he come out to me
      as a different man from the other one&mdash;the father...I shot at The
      Grange, at Woodbury. The father that lives with me in that ineffaceable
      Picture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He WAS a different man,&rdquo; Jack answered, with a sudden burst,
      as if he knew all my story. &ldquo;Una, I may as well relieve your mind
      all at once on that formidable point. You shot that man&rdquo;&mdash;he
      pointed to the white-bearded person in the photograph,&mdash;&ldquo;but it
      was not parricide: it was not even murder. It was under grave
      provocation...in more than self-defence...and he was NOT your father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my father!&rdquo; I cried, clasping my hands and leaning
      forward in my profound suspense. &ldquo;But I killed him all the same! Oh,
      Jack, how terrible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must quiet yourself, my child,&rdquo; he said, still soothing
      me automatically. &ldquo;I want your aid in this matter. You must listen
      to me calmly, and bring your mind to bear on all I say to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he began with a regular history of my early life, which came back to
      me as fast as he spoke, scene by scene and year by year, in long and
      familiar succession. I remembered everything, sometimes only when he
      suggested it; but sometimes also, before he said the words, my memory
      outran his tongue, and I put in a recollection or two with my own tongue
      as they recurred to me under the stimulus of this new birth of my dead
      nature. I recalled my early days in the far bush in Australia; my journey
      home to England on the big steamer with mamma; the way we travelled about
      for years from place to place on the Continent. I remembered how I had
      been strictly enjoined, too, never to speak of baby; and how my father
      used to watch my mother just as closely as he watched me, always afraid,
      as it appeared to me, she should make some verbal slip or let out some
      great secret in an unguarded moment. He seemed relieved, I recollected
      now, when my poor mother died: he grew less strict with me then, but as
      far as I could judge, though he was careful of my health, he never really
      loved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jack reminded me further of other scenes that came much later in my
      forgotten life. He reminded me of my trip to Torquay, where I first met
      him: and all at once the whole history of my old visits to the Moores came
      back like a flood to me. The memory seemed to inundate and overwhelm my
      brain. They were the happiest time of all life, those delightful visits,
      when I met Jack and fell in love with him, and half confided my love to my
      Cousin Minnie. Strange to say, though at Torquay itself I&rsquo;d
      forgotten it all, in that little Canadian house, with Jack by my side to
      recall it, it rushed back like a wave upon me. I&rsquo;d fallen in love
      with Jack without my father&rsquo;s knowledge or consent; and I knew very
      well my father would never allow me to marry him. He had ideas of his own,
      my father, about the sort of person I ought to marry: and I half suspected
      in my heart of hearts he meant if possible always to keep me at home
      single to take care of him and look after him. I didn&rsquo;t know, as
      yet, he had sufficient reasons of his own for desiring me to remain for
      ever unmarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered, too, that I never really loved my father. His nature was
      hard, cold, reserved, unsympathetic. I only feared and obeyed him. At
      times, my own strong character came out, I remembered, and I defied him to
      his face, defied him openly. Then there were scenes in the house, dreadful
      scenes, too hateful to dwell upon: and the servants came up to my room at
      the end and comforted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, step by step, Jack reminded me of everything in my own past life, up
      to the very night of the murder, from which my Second State dated. I&rsquo;d
      come back from Torquay a week or two before, very full indeed of Jack, and
      determined at all costs, sooner or later, to marry him. But though I had
      kept all quiet, papa had suspected my liking on the day of the Berry
      Pomeroy athletics, and had forbidden me to see Jack, or to write to him,
      or to have anything further to say to him. He was determined, he told me,
      whoever I married, I shouldn&rsquo;t at least marry a beggarly doctor. All
      that I remembered; and also how, in spite of the prohibition, I wrote
      letters to Jack, but could receive none in return&mdash;lest my father
      should see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still, the central mystery of the murder was no nearer solution. I
      held my breath in terror. Had I really any sort of justification in
      killing him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimly and instinctively, as Jack went on, a faint sense of resentment and
      righteous indignation against the man with the white beard rose up vaguely
      in my mind by slow degrees. I knew I had been angry with him, I knew I had
      defied him, but how or why as yet I knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jack suddenly paused, and began in a different voice a new part of
      his tale. It was nothing I remembered or could possibly remember, he said;
      but it was necessary to the comprehension of what came after, and would
      help me to recall it. About a week after I left Torquay, it seemed, Jack
      was in his consulting-room at Babbicombe one day, having just returned
      from a very long bicycle ride&mdash;for he was a first-rate cyclist,&mdash;when
      the servant announced a new patient; and a very worn-out old man came in
      to visit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had a ragged grey beard and scanty white hair; he was clad in poor
      clothes, and had tramped on foot all the way from London to Babbicombe,
      where Jack used to practice. But Jack saw at once under this rough
      exterior he had the voice and address of a cultivated gentleman, though he
      was so broken down by want and long suffering and exposure and illness
      that he looked like a beggar just let loose from the workhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held my breath as Jack showed me the poor old man&rsquo;s photograph. It
      was a portrait taken after death&mdash;for Jack attended him to the end
      through a fatal illness;&mdash;and it showed a face thin and worn, and
      much lined by unspeakable hardships. But I burst out crying at once the
      very moment I looked at it. For a second or two, I couldn&rsquo;t say why:
      I suppose it was instinct. Blood is thicker than water, they tell us; and
      I have the intuition of kindred very strong in me, I believe. But at any
      rate, I cried silently, with big hot tears, while I looked at that dead
      face of silent suffering, as I never had cried over the photograph of the
      respectable-looking man who lay dead on the floor of the library, and whom
      I was always taught to consider my father. Then it came back to me, why...
      I gazed at it and grew faint. I clutched Jack&rsquo;s arm for support. I
      knew what it meant now. The poor worn old man who lay dead on the bed with
      that look of mute agony on his features&mdash;was my first papa: the papa
      in the loose white linen coat: the one I remembered with childlike love
      and trustfulness in my earliest babyish Australian recollections!
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t mistake the face. It was burnt into my brain now. This
      was he, though much older and sadder, and more scarred and lined by age
      and weather. It was my very first papa. My own papa. I cried silently
      still. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at it. Then the real truth broke upon
      me once more. This, and this alone, was in very deed my one real father!
    </p>
    <p>
      I seized the faded photograph and pressed it to my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know him!&rdquo; I cried wildly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my father!
      My father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes passed before Jack could go on with his story. This rush of
      emotions was too much for me for a while. I could hardly hear him or
      attend to him, so deeply did it stir me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I calmed down, still holding that pathetic photograph on the table
      before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all about him,&rdquo; I murmured, sobbing. &ldquo;For,
      Jack, I remember now, he was so good and kind, and I loved him&mdash;I
      loved him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack went on with his story, trying to soothe me and reassure me. The old
      man introduced himself by very cautious degrees as a person in want, not
      so much of money, though of that to be sure he had none, as of kindness
      and sympathy in a very great sorrow. He was a shipwrecked mariner, in a
      sense: shipwrecked on the sea of Life and on the open Pacific as well. But
      once he had been a clergyman, and a man of education, position,
      reputation, fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually as he went on Jack began to grasp at the truth of this curious
      tale. The worn and battered stranger had but lately landed in London from
      a sailing vessel which had brought him over from a remote Pacific islet:
      not a tropical islet of the kind with whose palms and parrots we are all
      so familiar, but a cold and snowy rock, away off far south, among the
      frosts and icebergs, near the Antarctic continent. There for twenty long
      years that unhappy man had lived by himself a solitary life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started at the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For twenty years!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, Jack, you must be
      wrong; for how could that be? I was only eighteen when all this happened.
      How could my real father have been twenty years away from me, when I was
      only eighteen, and I remember him so perfectly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack looked at me and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve much to learn yet, Una,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The
      story&rsquo;s a long one. You were NOT eighteen but twenty-two at the
      time. You&rsquo;ve been deliberately misled as to your own age all along.
      You developed late, and were always short for your real years, not tall
      and precocious as we all of us imagined. But you were four years older
      than Mr. Callingham pretended. You&rsquo;re twenty-six now, not twenty-two
      as you think. Wait, and in time you&rsquo;ll hear all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on with his story. I listened, spell-bound. The unhappy man
      explained to Jack how he had been wrecked on the voyage, and escaped on a
      raft with one other passenger: how they had drifted far south, before
      waves and current, till they were cast at last on this wretched island:
      how they remained there for a month or two, picking up a precarious living
      on roots and berries and eggs of sea-birds: and how at last, one day, he
      had come back from hunting limpets and sea-urchins on the shore of a
      lonely bay&mdash;to find, to his amazement, his companion gone, and
      himself left alone on that desolate island. His fellow-castaway, he knew
      then, had deceived and deserted him!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no room, indeed, to doubt the treachery of the wretched being
      who had so basely treated him. As he looked, a ship under full sail stood
      away to northward. In vain the unhappy man made wild signals from the
      shore with his tattered garments. No notice was taken of them. His
      companion must deliberately have suppressed the other&rsquo;s existence,
      and pretended to be alone by himself on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name?&rdquo; Jack asked of the poor old man, horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger answered without a moment&rsquo;s pause:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name, if you want it&mdash;was Vivian Callingham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yours?&rdquo; Jack continued, as soon as he could recover from
      his first shock of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; the poor castaway replied, &ldquo;is Richard
      Wharton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jack told me those words, another strange thrill ran through me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Wharton was the name of mamma&rsquo;s first husband. Then I&rsquo;m
      not a Callingham at all!&rdquo; I cried, unable to take it all in at first
      in its full complexity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really a Wharton!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack nodded his head in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re really a Wharton,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      the baby that died, as we all were told. Your true Christian name&rsquo;s
      Mary. But, Una, you were always Una to all of us in England; and though
      the real Una Callingham died when you were a little girl of three or four
      years old, you&rsquo;ll be Una always now to Elsie and me. We can&rsquo;t
      think of you as other than we&rsquo;ve always called you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on to explain to me how the stranger had landed in London,
      alone and friendless, twenty years later, from a passing Australian
      merchant vessel which had picked him up on the island. All those years he
      had waited, and fed himself on eggs of penguins. He landed by himself, the
      crew having given him a suit of old clothes, and subscribed to find him in
      immediate necessaries. He began to inquire cautiously in London about his
      wife and family. At first, he could learn little or nothing; for nobody
      remembered him, and he feared to ask too openly, a sort of Enoch Arden
      terror restraining him from proclaiming his personality till he knew
      exactly what had happened in his long absence. But bit by bit, he found
      out at last that his wife had married again, and was now long dead: and
      that the man she had married was Vivian Callingham, his own treacherous
      companion on the Crozet Islands. As soon as he learned that, the full
      depth of the man&rsquo;s guilt burst upon him like a thunderbolt. Richard
      Wharton understood now why Vivian Callingham had left him alone on those
      desert rocks, and sailed away in the ship without telling the captain of
      his fellow-castaway&rsquo;s plight. He saw the whole vile plot the man had
      concocted at once, and the steps he had taken to carry it into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivian Callingham, whom I falsely thought my father, had gone back to
      Australia with pretended news of Richard Wharton&rsquo;s death. He had
      sought my widowed mother in her own home up country, and told her a lying
      tale of his devotion to her husband in his dying moments on that remote
      ocean speck in the far Southern Pacific. By this story he ingratiated
      himself. He knew she was rich: he knew she was worth marrying: and to
      marry her, he had left my own real father, Richard Wharton, to starve and
      languish for twenty years among rocks and sea-fowl on a lonely island!
    </p>
    <p>
      My blood ran cold at such a tale of deadly treachery. I remembered now to
      have heard some small part of it before. But much of it, as Jack told it
      to me, was quite new and unexpected. No wonder I had turned in horror that
      night from the man I long believed to be my own father, when I learned by
      what vile and cruelly treacherous means he had succeeded in imposing his
      supposed relationship upon me! But still, all this brought me no nearer
      the real question of questions&mdash;why did I shoot him?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; THE PLOT UNRAVELS ITSELF
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Jack went on unfolding that strange tale of fraud and heartless wrong,
      my interest every moment grew more and more absorbing. But I can&rsquo;t
      recall it now exactly as Jack told me it. I can only give you the
      substance of that terrible story.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Richard Wharton first learned of his wife&rsquo;s second marriage
      during his own lifetime to that wicked wretch who had ousted and
      supplanted him, he believed also, on the strength of Vivian Callingham&rsquo;s
      pretences, that his own daughter had died in her babyhood in Australia. He
      fancied, therefore, that no person of his kin remained alive at all, and
      that he might proceed to denounce and punish Vivian Callingham. With that
      object in view, he tramped down all the way from London to Torquay, to
      make himself known to his wife&rsquo;s relations, the Moores, and to their
      cousin, Courtenay Ivor of Babbicombe&mdash;my Jack, as I called him. For
      various reasons of his own, he called first on Jack, and proceeded to
      detail to him this terrible family story.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first hearing, Jack could hardly believe such a tale was true&mdash;of
      his Una&rsquo;s father, as he still thought Vivian Callingham. But a
      strange chance happened to reveal a still further complication. It came
      out in this way. I had given Jack a recent photograph of myself in fancy
      dress, which hung up over his mantelpiece. As the weather-worn visitor&rsquo;s
      eye fell on the picture, he started and grew pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s her!&rdquo; he cried with a sudden gasp. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      my daughter&mdash;Mary Wharton!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, naturally enough Jack thought, to begin with, this was a mere
      mistake on his strange visitor&rsquo;s part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her half-sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Una Callingham&mdash;your
      wife&rsquo;s child by her second marriage. She may be like her, no doubt,
      as half-sisters often are. But Mary Wharton, I know, died some eighteen
      years ago or so, when Una was quite a baby, I believe. I&rsquo;ve heard
      all about it, because, don&rsquo;t you see, I&rsquo;m engaged to Una.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor wreck of a clergyman, however, shook his head with profound
      conviction. He knew better than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; he said decisively: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my child,
      Mary Wharton. Even after all these years, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly be
      mistaken. Blood is thicker than water: I&rsquo;d know her among ten
      thousand. She&rsquo;d be just that age now, too. I see the creature&rsquo;s
      vile plot. His daughter died young, and he&rsquo;s palmed off my Mary as
      his own child, to keep her money in his hands. But never mind the money.
      Thank Heaven, she&rsquo;s alive! That&rsquo;s her! That&rsquo;s my Mary!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The plot seemed too diabolical and too improbable for anybody to believe.
      Jack could hardly think it possible when his new friend told him. But the
      stranger persisted so&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard for me even to think of him as
      quite really my father&mdash;that Jack at last brought out two or three
      earlier photographs I&rsquo;d given him some time before; and his visitor
      recognised them at once, in all their stages, as his own daughter. This
      roused Jack&rsquo;s curiosity. He determined to hunt the matter up with
      his unknown connection. And he hunted it up thenceforward with deliberate
      care, till he proved every word of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the poor broken-down man, worn out with his long tramp and his
      terrible emotions, fell ill almost at once, in Jack&rsquo;s own house, and
      became rapidly so feeble that Jack dared not question him further. The
      return to civilisation was more fatal than his long solitary banishment.
      At the end of a week he died, leaving on Jack&rsquo;s mind a profound
      conviction that all he had said was true, and that I was really Richard
      Wharton&rsquo;s daughter, not Vivian Callingham&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a week or two I made inquiries, Una,&rdquo; Jack said to me as
      we sat there,&mdash;&ldquo;inquiries which I won&rsquo;t detail to you in
      full just now, but which gradually showed me the truth of the poor soul&rsquo;s
      belief. What you yourself told me just now chimes in exactly with what I
      discovered elsewhere, by inquiry and by letters from Australia. The baby
      that died was the real Una Callingham. Shortly after its death, your
      stepfather and your mother left the colony. All your real father&rsquo;s
      money had been bequeathed to his child: and your mother&rsquo;s also was
      settled on you. Mr. Callingham saw that if your mother died, and you lived
      and married, he himself would be deprived of the fortune for which he had
      so wickedly plotted. So he made up another plot even more extraordinary
      and more diabolical still than the first. He decided to pretend it was
      Mary Wharton that died, and to palm you off on the world as his own child,
      Una Callingham. For if Mary Wharton died, the property at once became
      absolutely your mother&rsquo;s, and she could will it away to her husband
      or anyone else she chose to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But baby was so much younger than I!&rdquo; I cried, going back on
      my recollections once more. &ldquo;How could he ever manage to make the
      dates come right again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; Jack answered; &ldquo;the baby was younger than
      you. But your step-father&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no other name by which I can
      call him&mdash;made a clever plan to set that straight. He concealed from
      the people in Australia which child had been ill, and he entered her death
      as Mary Wharton. Then, to cover the falsification, he left Melbourne at
      once, and travelled about for some years on the Continent in
      out-of-the-way places till all had been forgotten. You went forth upon the
      world as Una Callingham, with your true personality as Mary Wharton all
      obscured even in your own memory. Fortunately for your false father&rsquo;s
      plot, you were small for your age, and developed slowly: he gave out, on
      the contrary, that you were big for your years and had outgrown yourself,
      Australian-wise, both in wisdom and stature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my mother!&rdquo; I exclaimed, appalled. &ldquo;How could she
      ever consent to such a wicked deception?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Callingham had your mother completely under his thumb,&rdquo;
      Jack answered with promptitude. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t call her soul
      her own, your poor mother&mdash;so I&rsquo;ve heard: he cajoled her and
      terrified her till she didn&rsquo;t dare to oppose him. Poor shrinking
      creature, she was afraid of her life to do anything except as he bade her.
      He must have persuaded her first to acquiesce passively in this hateful
      plot, and then must have terrified her afterwards into full compliance by
      threats of exposure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a very unhappy man himself,&rdquo; I put in, casting back.
      &ldquo;His money did him no good. I can remember now how gloomy and moody
      he was often, at The Grange.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;He lived in perpetual fear
      of your real father&rsquo;s return, or of some other breakdown to his
      complicated system of successive deceptions. He never had a happy minute
      in his whole life, I believe. Blind terrors surrounded him. He was afraid
      of everything, and afraid of everybody. Only his scientific work seemed
      ever to give him any relief. There, he became a free man. He threw himself
      into that, heart and soul, on purpose, I fancy, because it absorbed him
      while he was at it, and prevented him for the time being from thinking of
      his position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you find it all out?&rdquo; I asked eagerly, anxious to
      get on to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s long to tell,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;Too
      long for one sitting. I won&rsquo;t trouble you with it now. Discrepancies
      in facts and dates, and inquiries among servants both in England and in
      Victoria, first put me upon the track. But I said nothing at the time of
      my suspicions to anyone. I waited till I could appeal to the man&rsquo;s
      own conscience with success, as I hoped. And then, besides, I hardly knew
      how to act for the best. I wanted to marry you; and therefore, as far as
      was consistent with justice and honour, I wished to spare your supposed
      father a complete exposure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell the police?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I had really nothing definite in any way to go upon.
      Realise the position to yourself, and you&rsquo;ll see how difficult it
      was for me. Mr. Callingham suspected I was paying you attentions. Clearly,
      under those circumstances, it was to my obvious interest that you should
      get possession of all his property. Any claims I might make for you would,
      therefore, be naturally regarded with suspicion. The shipwrecked man had
      told nobody but myself. I hadn&rsquo;t even an affidavit, a death-bed
      statement. All rested upon his word, and upon mine as retailing it. He was
      dead, and there was nothing but my narrative for what he told me. The
      story itself was too improbable to be believed by the police on such
      dubious evidence. I didn&rsquo;t even care to try. I wanted to make your
      step-father confess: and I waited for that till I could compel confession.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; MY MEMORY RETURNS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last my chance came,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d found
      out almost everything; not, of course, exactly by way of legal proof, but
      to my own entire satisfaction: and I determined to lay the matter
      definitely at once before Mr. Callingham. So I took a holiday for a
      fortnight, to go bicycling in the Midlands I told my patients; and I fixed
      my head-quarters at Wrode, which, as you probably remember, is twenty
      miles off from Woodbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was important for my scheme I should catch Mr. Callingham alone.
      I had no idea of entrapping him. I wanted to work upon his conscience and
      induce him to confess. My object was rather to move him to remorse and
      restitution than to terrify or surprise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So on the day of the accident&mdash;call it murder, if you will&mdash;I
      rode over on my machine, unannounced, to The Grange to see him. You knew
      where I was staying, you recollect&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the words, a burst of memory came suddenly over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I remember. It was at the Wilsons&rsquo;,
      at Wrode. I wrote over there to tell you we were going to dine alone at
      six that evening, as papa had got his electric apparatus home from his
      instrument-maker, and was anxious to try his experiments early. You&rsquo;d
      written to me privately&mdash;a boy brought the note&mdash;that you wanted
      to have an hour&rsquo;s talk alone with papa. I thought it was about ME,
      and I was, oh, ever so nervous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For it all came back to me now, as clear as yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack looked at me hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you remember that, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now,
      Una, do try to remember all you can as I go along with my story... Well, I
      rode over alone, never telling anybody at Wrode where I was going, nor
      giving your step-father any reason of any sort to expect me. I trusted
      entirely to finding him busy with his new invention. When I reached The
      Grange, I came up the drive unperceived, and looking in at the library
      window, saw your father alone there. He was pottering over his chemicals.
      That gave me the clue. I left my bicycle under the window, tilted up
      against the wall, and walked in without ringing, going straight to the
      library. Nobody saw me come: nobody saw me return, except one old lady on
      the road, who seemed to have forgotten all about it by the time of the
      inquest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (I nodded and gave a start. I knew that must have been Aunt Emma.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except yourself, Una, no human soul on earth ever seemed to suspect
      me. And that wasn&rsquo;t odd; for you and your father, and perhaps Minnie
      Moore, were the only people in the world who ever knew I was in love with
      you or cared for you in any way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said, breathless. &ldquo;And you went into the
      library.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went into the library,&rdquo; Jack continued, &ldquo;where I
      found your father, just returned from enjoying his cigar on the lawn. He
      was alone in the room&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I cried eagerly, putting in my share now; for I had
      a part in the history. &ldquo;He WASN&rsquo;T alone, Jack, though you
      thought him so at the time. I remember all, at last. It comes back to me
      like a flash. Oh, heavens, how it comes back to me! Jack, Jack, I remember
      to-day every word, every syllable of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at me in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me yourself, Una!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How did you
      come to be there? For I knew you were there at last; but till you fired
      the pistol, I hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea you had heard or seen
      anything. Tell me all about it, quick! There comes in MY mystery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In one wild rush of thought the whole picture rose up like a vision before
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jack,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;there was a screen, a little
      screen in the alcove! You remember the alcove at the west end of the room.
      It was so small a screen, you&rsquo;d hardly have thought it could hide
      me; but it did&mdash;it did&mdash;and all, too, by accident. I&rsquo;d
      gone in there after dinner, not much thinking where I went, and was seated
      on the floor by the little alcove window, reading a book by the twilight.
      It was a book papa told me I wasn&rsquo;t to read, and I took it trembling
      from the shelves, and was afraid he&rsquo;d scold me&mdash;for you know
      how stern he was. And I never was allowed to go alone into the library.
      But I got interested in my book, and went on reading. So when he came in,
      I went on sitting there very still, with the book hidden under my skirt,
      for fear he should scold me. I thought perhaps before long papa&rsquo;d go
      out for a second, to get some plates for his photography or something, and
      then I could slip away and never be noticed. The big window towards the
      garden was open, you remember, and I meant to jump out of it&mdash;as you
      did afterwards. It wasn&rsquo;t very high; and though the book was only
      The Vicar of Wakefield, he&rsquo;d forbidden me to read it, and I was
      dreadfully afraid of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were there all the time?&rdquo; Jack cried
      interrogatively. &ldquo;And you heard our conversation&mdash;our whole
      conversation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there all the time, Jack,&rdquo; I cried, in a fever of
      exaltation: &ldquo;and I heard every word of it! It comes back to me now
      with a vividness like yesterday. I see the room before my eyes. I remember
      every syllable: I could repeat every sentence of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack drew a deep sigh of intense relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with profound gratitude.
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m saved, and you&rsquo;re saved. We can both
      understand one another in that case. We know how it all happened!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I know all now. As I sat there
      and cowered, I heard a knock at the door, and before papa could answer,
      you entered hastily. Papa looked round, I could hear, and saw who it was
      in a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rsquo; he said, coldly. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      you, Dr. Ivor. And pray, sir, what do you want here this evening?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Jack cried, intensely relieved, I could feel. &ldquo;Let
      me see how much more you can remember, Una.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you shut the door softly and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s I, Mr. Callingham,&rsquo;&rdquo; I continued
      all aglow, and looking into his eyes for confirmation. &ldquo;&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve
      come to tell you a fact that may surprise you. Prepare for strange news.
      Richard Wharton has returned to England!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew Richard Wharton was mamma&rsquo;s first husband, who was
      dead before I was born, as I&rsquo;d always been told: and I sat there
      aghast at the news: it was so sudden, so crushing. I&rsquo;d heard he&rsquo;d
      been wrecked, and I thought he&rsquo;d come to life again; but as yet I
      didn&rsquo;t suspect what was all the real meaning of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But papa drew back, I could hear, in a perfect frenzy of rage,
      astonishment, and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Richard Wharton!&rsquo; he hissed out between his teeth,
      springing away like one stung. &lsquo;Richard Wharton come back! You liar!
      You sneak! He&rsquo;s dead this twenty years! You&rsquo;re trying to
      frighten me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never meant to overhear your conversation. But at that, it was so
      strange, I drew back and cowered even closer. I was afraid of papa&rsquo;s
      voice. I was afraid of his rage. He spoke just like a man who was ready to
      murder you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you began to talk with papa about strange things that
      astonished me&mdash;strange things that I only half understood just then,
      but that by the light of what you&rsquo;ve told me to-day I quite
      understand now&mdash;the history of my real father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m no liar,&rsquo; you answered. &lsquo;Richard
      Wharton has come back. And by the aid of what he&rsquo;s disclosed, I know
      the whole truth. The girl you call your daughter, and whose money you&rsquo;ve
      stolen, is not yours at all. She&rsquo;s Richard Wharton&rsquo;s daughter
      Mary!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa staggered back a pace or two, and came quite close to the
      screen. I cowered behind it in alarm. I could see he was terrified. For a
      minute or two you talked with him, and urged him to confess. Bit by bit,
      as you went on, he recovered his nerve, and began to bluster. He didn&rsquo;t
      deny what you said: he saw it was no use: he just sneered and
      prevaricated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I listened to his words, I saw he admitted it all. A great
      horror came over me. Then my life was one long lie! He was never my
      father. He had concocted a vile plot. He had held me in this slavery so
      many years to suit his own purposes. He had crushed my mother to death,
      and robbed me of my birthright. Even before that night, I never loved him.
      I thought it very wicked of me, but I never could love him. As he spoke to
      you and grew cynical, I began to loathe and despise him. I can&rsquo;t
      tell you how great a comfort it was to me to know&mdash;to hear from his
      own lips I was not that man&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, after many recriminations, he looked across at you, and
      said, half laughing, for he was quite himself again by that time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This is all very fine, Courtenay Ivor&mdash;all very fine in
      its way; but how are you going to prove it? that&rsquo;s the real
      question. Do you think any jury in England will believe, on your
      unsupported oath, such a cock-and-bull story? Do you think, even if
      Richard Wharton&rsquo;s come back, and you&rsquo;ve got him on your side,
      I can&rsquo;t cross-examine all the life out of his body?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that you said gravely&mdash;wanting to touch his conscience, I
      suppose:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Richard Wharton&rsquo;s come back, but you can&rsquo;t
      cross-examine him. For Richard Wharton died some six or eight weeks since
      at my cottage at Babbicombe, after revealing to me all this vile plot
      against himself and his daughter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then papa drew back with a loud laugh&mdash;a hateful laugh like a
      demon&rsquo;s. I can&rsquo;t help calling him papa still, though it pains
      me even to think of him. That loud laugh rings still in my ears to this
      day. It was horrible, diabolical, like a wild beast&rsquo;s in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You fool!&rsquo; he said, with a sneer. &lsquo;And you come
      here to tell me that! You infernal idiot! You come here to put yourself in
      my power like this! Courtenay Ivor, I always knew you were an ass, but I
      didn&rsquo;t ever know you were quite such a born idiot of a fellow as
      that. Hold back there, you image!&rsquo; With a rapid dart, before you
      could see what he was doing, he passed a wire round your body and thrust
      two knobs into your hands. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re in my power now!&rsquo; he
      exclaimed. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t move or stir!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw at once what he&rsquo;d done. He&rsquo;d pinned you to the
      spot with the handles of his powerful electric apparatus. It was so strong
      that it would hold one riveted to the spot in pain. You couldn&rsquo;t let
      go. You could hardly even speak or cry aloud for help. He had pinned you
      down irresistibly. I thought he meant to murder you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I was too terrified, even so, to scream aloud for the servants.
      I only crouched there, rooted, and wondered what next would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went across to the door and turned the key in it. Then he opened
      the cabinet and took out some things there. It was growing quite dusk, and
      I could hardly see them. He returned with them where you stood, struggling
      in vain to set yourself free. His voice was as hard as adamant now. He
      spoke slowly and distinctly, in a voice like a fiend&rsquo;s. Oh, Jack, no
      wonder that scene took away my reason!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can remember what he said next, Una?&rdquo; Jack asked,
      following me eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can remember what he said next,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;He
      stood over you threateningly. I could see then the thing he held in his
      right hand was a loaded revolver. In his left was a bottle, a small
      medical phial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you stir, I&rsquo;ll shoot you,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      shoot you like a dog! You fool, you&rsquo;ve sealed your own fate! What an
      idiot to let me know Richard Wharton&rsquo;s dead! Now, hear your fate!
      Nobody saw you come into this house to-night. Nobody shall see you leave.
      Look here, sir, at this bottle. It&rsquo;s chloroform: do you understand?
      Chloroform&mdash;chloroform&mdash;chloroform! I shall hold it to your nose&mdash;so.
      I shall stifle you quietly&mdash;no blood, no fuss, no nasty mess of any
      sort. And when I&rsquo;m done,&mdash;do you see these flasks?&mdash;I can
      reduce your damned carcase to a pound of ashes with chemicals in
      half-an-hour! You&rsquo;ve found out too much. But you&rsquo;ve mistaken
      your man! Courtenay Ivor, say your prayers and commend your soul to the
      devil! You&rsquo;ve driven me to bay, and I give you no quarter!&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; THE FATAL SHOT
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, Una,&rdquo; Jack cried, &ldquo;you remember it now even
      better than I do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember it!&rdquo; I answered, holding my brow with my hands to
      keep the flood of thought from bursting it to fragments. &ldquo;Remember
      it! Why, it comes back to me like waves of fire and burns me. I remember
      every word, every act, every gesture. I lifted my head slowly, Jack, and
      looked over the screen at him. In the twilight, I saw him there&mdash;the
      man I called my father&mdash;holding the bottle to your face, that wicked
      bottle of chloroform, with his revolver in one hand, and a calm smile like
      a fiend&rsquo;s playing hatefully and cruelly round that grave-looking
      mouth of his. I never saw any man look so ghastly in my life. I was rooted
      to the spot with awe and terror. I dared hardly cry out or move. Yet I
      knew this was murder. He would kill you! He would kill you! He was trying
      to poison you before my very eyes. Oh, heaven, how I hated him! He was no
      father of mine. He had never been my father. And he was murdering the man
      I loved best in the world. For I loved you better than life, Jack! Oh, the
      strain of it was terrible! I see it all now. I live it all over again.
      With one wild bound I leapt forward, and, hardly knowing what I did, I
      pressed the button, turned off the current from the battery, and rushed
      wildly upon him. I suppose the knob I pressed not only released you, but
      set the photographic machine at work automatically. But I didn&rsquo;t
      know it then. At any rate, I remember now, in the seconds that followed,
      flash came fast after flash. There was a sudden illumination. The room was
      lighter than day. It grew alternately bright as noon and then dark as
      pitch again by contrast. And by the light of the flashes, I saw you,
      half-dazed with the chloroform, standing helpless there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rushed up and caught the man&rsquo;s arm. He was never my father!
      He dropped the bottle and struggled hard for possession of the pistol.
      First he pointed it at you, then at me, then at you again. He meant to
      shoot you. I was afraid it would go off. With a terrible effort I twisted
      his wrist awry, in the mad force of passion, and wrenched the revolver
      away from him. He jumped at my throat, still silent, but fierce like a
      tiger at bay. I eluded him, and sprang back. Then I remember no more,
      except that I stood with the pistol pointed at him. Next, came a flash, a
      loud roar. And then, in a moment, the Picture. He lay dead on the floor in
      his blood. And my Second State began. And from that day, for months, I was
      like a little child again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack looked at me as I paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; he went on in a very low voice, half prompting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then all I can remember,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is how you got
      out of the window. But I didn&rsquo;t know when I saw you, it was you or
      anyone else. That was my Second State then. The shot seemed to end all.
      What comes next is quite different. It belongs to the new world. There, my
      life stopped dead short and began all over again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moments silence. Jack was the first to break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now will you give yourself up to the police, Una?&rdquo; he
      asked me quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question brought me back to the present again with a bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what ought I to do?&rdquo; I cried, wringing my hands. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t quite know all yet. Jack, why did you run away that last
      moment and leave me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack took my hand very seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una, my child,&rdquo; he said, fixing his eyes on mine, &ldquo;I
      hardly know whether I can ever make you understand all that. I must ask
      you at first at least just simply to believe me. I must ask you to trust
      me and to accept my account. When you rushed upon me as I stood there, all
      entangled in that hateful apparatus, and unable to move, I didn&rsquo;t
      know where you had been; I didn&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;d come there.
      But I felt sure you must have heard at least your false father&rsquo;s
      last words&mdash;that he&rsquo;d stifle me with the chloroform and burn my
      body up afterwards to ashes with his chemicals. You seized the pistol
      before I could quite recover from the effects of the fumes. He lay dead at
      my feet before I realised what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in a moment, as I looked at you, I took it all in, like a
      flash of lightning. I saw how impossible it would be ever to convince
      anybody else of the truth of our story. I saw if we both told the truth,
      no one would ever believe us. There was no time then to reflect, no time
      to hesitate. I had to make up my mind at once to a plan of action, and to
      carry it out without a second&rsquo;s delay. In one burst of inspiration,
      I saw that to stop would be to seal both our fates. I didn&rsquo;t mind so
      much for myself; that was nothing, nothing: but for your sake I felt I
      must dare and risk everything. Then I turned round and looked at you. I
      saw at one glance the horror of the moment had rendered you speechless and
      almost senseless. The right plan came to me at once as if by magic.
      &lsquo;Una,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;stand back! Wait till the servants
      come!&rsquo; For I knew the report of the revolver would soon bring them
      up to the library. Then I waited myself. As they reached the door, and
      forced it open, I jumped up to the window. Just outside, my bicycle stood
      propped against the wall. I let them purposely catch just a glimpse of my
      back&mdash;an unfamiliar figure. They saw the pistol on the floor,&mdash;Mr.
      Callingham dead&mdash;you, startled and horrified&mdash;a man unknown,
      escaping in hot haste from the window. I risked my own life, so as to save
      your name and honour. I let them see me escape, so as to exonerate you
      from suspicion. If they hanged me, what matter? Then I leapt down in a
      hurry, jumped lightly on my machine, and rode off like the wind down the
      avenue to the high-road. For a second or two they waited to look at you
      and your father. That second or two saved us. By the time they&rsquo;d
      come out to look, I was away down the grounds, past the turn of the
      avenue, and well on for the high-road. They&rsquo;d seen a glimpse of the
      murderer, escaping by the window. They would never suspect YOU. You were
      saved, and I was happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for the same reason even now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t
      tell the police?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let sleeping dogs lie,&rdquo; Jack answered, in the same words as
      Dr. Marten. &ldquo;Why rake up this whole matter? It&rsquo;s finished for
      ever now, and nobody but yourself is ever likely to reopen it. If we both
      told our tale, we might run a great risk of being seriously
      misinterpreted. You know it&rsquo;s true; so do I: but who else would
      believe us? No man&rsquo;s bound to criminate himself. You shot him to
      save my life, at the very moment when you first learned all his cruelty
      and his vileness. The rest of the world could never be made to understand
      all that. They&rsquo;d say to the end, as it looks on the surface, &lsquo;She
      shot her father to save her lover.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; I said slowly. &ldquo;I shall let this
      thing rest. But the photographs, Jack&mdash;the apparatus&mdash;the affair
      of the inquest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was all very simple,&rdquo; Jack answered. &ldquo;For a day or
      two, of course, I was in a frantic state of mind for fear you should be
      suspected, or the revolver should betray you. But though I saw the
      electric sparks, of course, I knew nothing about the photographs. I wasn&rsquo;t
      even aware that the apparatus took negatives automatically. And I was so
      full of the terrible reports in the newspapers about your sudden loss of
      health, that I could think of nothing else&mdash;least of all my own
      safety. As good luck would have it, however, the clergyman at Wrode, who
      knew the Wilsons, happened to speak to me of the murder&mdash;all England
      called it the murder and talked of nothing else for at least a fortnight,&mdash;and
      in the course of conversation he mentioned this apparatus of Mr.
      Callingham&rsquo;s construction. &lsquo;What a pity,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;there didn&rsquo;t happen to be one of them in the library at the
      time! If it was focussed towards the persons, and had been set on by the
      victim, it would have photographed the whole scene the murder, the
      murderer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hint revealed much to me. As he spoke, I remembered suddenly
      about those mysterious flashes when you burst all at once on my sight from
      behind the screen. Till that moment, I thought of them only as some result
      of your too suddenly turning off the electric current. But then, it came
      home to me in a second that Mr. Callingham must have set out his apparatus
      all ready for experimenting&mdash;that the electric apparatus was there to
      put it in working order. The button you turned must not only have stopped
      the current that nailed me writhing to the spot: it must also have set
      working the automatic photographic camera!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That thought, as you may imagine, filled me with speechless alarm:
      for I remembered then that one of the flashes broke upon us at the exact
      moment when you fired the pistol. Such a possibility was horrible to
      contemplate. The photographs by themselves could give no clue to our
      conversation or to the events that compelled you, almost against your own
      will, to fire that fatal shot. If they were found by the police, all would
      be up with both of us. They might hang ME if they liked: except for Elsie&rsquo;s
      sake, I didn&rsquo;t mind much about that: but for your safety, come what
      might, I felt I must manage to get hold of them or to destroy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were the negatives already in the hands of the police? That was now
      the great question. I read the reports diligently, with all their
      descriptions of the room, and noticed that while the table, the alcove,
      the screen, the box, the electrical apparatus, were all carefully
      mentioned, not a word was said anywhere about the possession of the
      negatives. Reasoning further upon the description of the supposed murderer
      as given by the servants, and placarded broadcast in every town in
      England, I came to the conclusion that the police couldn&rsquo;t yet have
      discovered the existence of these negatives: for some of them must surely
      have photographed my face, however little in focus; while the printed
      descriptions mentioned only the man&rsquo;s back, as the servants saw him
      escaping from the window. The papers said the room was being kept closed
      till the inquest, for inspection in due time by the coroner&rsquo;s jury.
      I made up my mind at once. When the room was opened for the jurors to view
      it, I must get in there and carry them off, if they caught me in the
      attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no use trying before the jury had seen the room. But as soon
      as that was all over, I judged the strictness of the watch upon the
      premises would be relaxed, and the windows would probably be opened a
      little to air the place. So on the morning of the inquest, I told the
      Wilsons casually I&rsquo;d met you at Torquay and had therefore a sort of
      interest in learning the result of the coroner&rsquo;s deliberation. Then
      I took my bicycle, and rode across to Woodbury. Leaning up my machine
      against the garden wall, I walked carelessly in at the gate, and up the
      walk to the library window, as if the place belonged to me. Oh, how my
      heart beat as I looked in and wondered! The folding halves were open, and
      the box stood on the table, still connected with the wires that conducted
      the electrical current. I stood and hesitated in alarm. Were the negatives
      still there, or had the police discovered them? If they were gone, all was
      up with you. The game was lost. No jury on earth, I felt sure, would
      believe my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vaulted up to the sill. Thank heaven, I was athletic. Not a soul
      was about: but I heard a noise of muffled voices in the other rooms
      behind. Treading cat-like across the floor, I turned the key in the lock.
      A chalk mark still showed the position of the pistol on the ground exactly
      as you flung it. The box was on the table, and I saw at a glance, the
      wires which connected it with the battery had never been disconnected. I
      was afraid of receiving a shock if I touched them with my hands, and I had
      no time to waste in discovering electrical attachments. So I pulled out my
      knife, and you can fancy with what trembling hands I cut that wire on
      either side and released the box from its dangerous connections. I knew
      only too well the force of that current. Then I took the thing under my
      arm, leaped from the window once more, and ran across the shrubbery
      towards the spot where I&rsquo;d left my bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the way, the thought struck me that if I carried along the
      camera, all would be up with me should I happen to be challenged. It was
      the only one of the sort in existence at the time, and the wires at the
      side would at once suffice to identify it and to arouse the suspicion even
      of an English policeman. I paused for a moment behind a thick clump of
      lilacs and tried to pull out the incriminating negatives. Oh, Una, I did
      it for your sake; but there, terrified and trembling, in hiding behind the
      bushes, and in danger of my life, with that still more unspeakable danger
      for yours haunting me always like a nightmare, can you wonder that for the
      moment I almost felt myself a murderer? The very breezes in the trees made
      my heart give a jump, and then stand still within me. I got out the first
      two or three plates with some trifling difficulty, for I didn&rsquo;t
      understand the automatic apparatus then as I understand it now: but the
      fourth stuck hard for a minute; the fifth broke in two; and the sixth&mdash;well,
      the sixth plate baffled me entirely by getting jammed in the clockwork,
      and refusing to move, either backward or forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that moment, I either heard or fancied I heard a loud noise of
      pursuit, a hue and cry behind me. Zeal for your safety had made me
      preternaturally nervous. I looked about me hurriedly, thrust the negatives
      I&rsquo;d recovered into my breast-pocket as fast as ever I could, flung
      the apparatus away from me with the sixth plate jammed hard in the groove,
      and made off at the top of my speed for the wall behind me. For there, at
      that critical point, it occurred to me suddenly that the sixth and last
      flash of the machine had come and gone just as I stood poising myself on
      the ledge of the window-sill; and I thought to myself&mdash;rightly as it
      turned out&mdash;this additional evidence would only strengthen the belief
      in the public mind that Mr. Callingham had been murdered by the man whom
      the servants saw escaping from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest, my child, you know pretty well already. In a panic on
      your account, I scrambled over the wall, tearing my hands as I went with
      that nasty-bottle glass, reached my bicycle outside, and made off, not for
      the country, but for the inn where they were holding the coroner&rsquo;s
      inquest. My left hand I had to hold, tied up in my handkerchief to stop
      the bleeding, in the pocket of my jacket: but I thought this the best way,
      all the same, to escape detection. And, indeed, instead of being, as I
      feared, the only man there in bicycling dress and knickerbockers, I found
      the occasion had positively attracted all the cyclists of the
      neighbourhood. Each man went there to show his own innocence of fear or
      suspicion. A good dozen or two of bicyclists stood gathered already in the
      body of the room in the same incriminating costume. So I found safety in
      numbers. Even the servants who had seen me disappear through the window,
      though their eyes lighted upon me more than once, never for a moment
      seemed to suspect me. And I know very well why. When I stand up, I&rsquo;m
      the straightest and most perpendicular man that ever walked erect. But
      when I poise to jump, I bend my spine so much that I produce the
      impression of being almost hump-backed. It was that attitude you
      recognised in me when I jumped from the window just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jack,&rdquo; I cried clinging to him in a perfect whirlwind of
      wonder, &ldquo;one can hardly believe it&mdash;that was only an hour ago!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was only an hour ago,&rdquo; Jack answered, smiling. &ldquo;But
      as for you, I suppose you&rsquo;ve lived half a lifetime again in it. And
      now you know the whole secret of the Woodbury Mystery. And you won&rsquo;t
      want to give yourself up to the police any longer.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; ALL&rsquo;S WELL THAT ENDS WELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you explain it all to me at the very first?&rdquo;
      I exclaimed, all tremulous. &ldquo;When you met me at Quebec, I mean&mdash;why
      didn&rsquo;t you tell me then? Did you and Elsie come there on purpose to
      meet me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we came there to meet you,&rdquo; Jack answered. &ldquo;But we
      were afraid to make ourselves known to you all at once just at first,
      because, you see, Una, I more than half suspected then, what I know now to
      be the truth, that you were coming out to Canada on purpose to hunt me up,
      not as your friend and future husband, but in enmity and suspicion as your
      father&rsquo;s murderer. And in any case we were uncertain which attitude
      you might adopt towards me. But I see I must explain a little more even
      now. I haven&rsquo;t told you yet why I came at all to Canada.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me now,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I must know everything
      to-day. I can never rest now till I&rsquo;ve heard the whole story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jack went on more calmly, &ldquo;after the first
      excitement wore off in the public mind, there came after a bit a lull of
      languid interest; the papers began to forget the supposed facts of the
      murder, and to dwell far more upon your own new role as a psychological
      curiosity. They talked much about your strange new life and its analogies
      elsewhere. I was anxious to see you, of course, to satisfy myself of your
      condition; but the doctors who had charge of you refused to let you mix
      for a while with anyone you had known in your First State; and I now think
      wisely. It was best you should recover your general health and faculties
      by slow degrees, without being puzzled and distracted by constant
      upsetting recollections and suggestions of your past history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for me, of course, at the time, the separation was terrible.
      Each morning, I read with feverish interest the reports of your health,
      and longed, day after day, to hear of some distinct improvement. And yet
      at the same time, I was terrified at every approach to complete
      convalescence: I feared that if you got better at all, you might remember
      too quick, and that then the sudden rush of recollection might kill you or
      upset your reason. But by-and-by, it became clear to me you could remember
      nothing of the actual shot itself. And I saw plainly why. It was the
      firing of the pistol that obliterated, as it were, every trace of your
      past life in your disorganised brain. And it obliterated ITSELF too. Your
      new life began just one moment later, with the Picture of the dead man
      stretched before you in his blood on the floor, and a figure in the
      background disappearing through the window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How clever he was, to be sure! I saw in a moment Jack had interpreted my
      whole frame of mind correctly and wonderfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I went back to Babbicombe,&rdquo; Jack continued, &ldquo;and,
      lest my heart should break for want of human sympathy, I confided every
      word of my terrible story to Elsie. Elsie can trust me; and Elsie believed
      me. Gradually, as you began to recover, I realised the soundness of your
      doctor&rsquo;s idea that you should be allowed to come back to yourself by
      re-education from the very beginning, without any too early intrusion of
      reminiscences from your previous life to confuse and disturb you. But I
      couldn&rsquo;t go on with my profession, all the same, while I waited. I
      couldn&rsquo;t attend as I ought to my patients&rsquo; wants and ailments:
      I was too concentrated upon you: the strain was too great upon me. So I
      threw up my practice, came out to Canada, bought a bit of land, and began
      farming here, and seeing a few patients now and again locally, just to
      fill up my time with. I felt confident in the end you would recover and
      remember me. I felt confident you would come to yourself and marry me. But
      still, it was very long work waiting. Every month, Elsie got news
      indirectly from Minnie Moore or someone of your state of health; and I
      intended to go back and try to see you as soon as ever you were in a
      condition to bear the shock of re-living your previous life again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, however, the police got hold of YOU before I could
      carry my plan into execution. As soon as I heard that, I made up my mind
      at once to go home by the first mail and break it all gently to you. So
      Elsie and I started for Quebec, meaning to sail by the Dominion steamer
      for England. But at the hotel at Quebec we saw the telegrams announcing
      that you were then on your way out to Canada. Well, of course we didn&rsquo;t
      feel sure whether you came as a friend or an enemy. We were certain it was
      to seek me out you were coming to America; but whether you remembered me
      still and still loved me, or whether you&rsquo;d found out some stray clue
      to the missing man, and were anxious to hunt me down as your father&rsquo;s
      murderer, we hadn&rsquo;t the slightest conception. So under those
      circumstances, we thought it best not to meet you ourselves at the
      steamer, or to reveal our identity too soon, for fear of a catastrophe. I
      knew it would be better to wait and watch&mdash;to gain your confidence,
      if possible&mdash;in any case, to find out how you were affected on first
      seeing us and talking with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, as the time came on for the Sarmatian to arrive, it
      began to strike me by degrees that all Quebec was agog with curiosity to
      see you. I dared not go down to meet you at the quay myself; but the Chief
      Constable of Quebec, Major Tascherel, was an old friend and fellow-officer
      of my father&rsquo;s; and when I explained to him my fears that you might
      be mobbed by sightseers on your arrival at the harbour, and told him how
      afraid I was of the shock it might give you to meet an old friend
      unexpectedly at the steamer&rsquo;s side, he very kindly consented to go
      down and see you safe through the Custom House, It was so lucky I knew
      him. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that, you might have been horribly
      inconvenienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you may imagine, when we first saw you get into the Pullman car,
      both Elsie and I felt our hearts come up into our months with suspense and
      anxiety. We&rsquo;d arranged it all so on purpose, for we felt sure you
      were on your way to Palmyra to find us: but when it came to the actual
      crisis, we wondered most nervously what effect the sight of us might have
      upon your system. But in a moment, I saw you didn&rsquo;t remember us at
      all, or only vaguely attached to us some faint sense of friendliness. That
      was well, because it enabled us to gain your confidence easily. As we
      spoke with you, the sense of friendly interest deepened. I knew that, all
      unconsciously to yourself, you loved me still, and that in a very short
      time, if only I could see you and be with you, I might bring all back to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack paused and looked at me. As he paused, I felt my old self revive
      again more completely than ever with a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jack,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;so you HAVE done; so you HAVE
      brought all back to me! My Second State&rsquo;s over: I&rsquo;m the same
      girl you used to know at Torquay once more. I remember everything&mdash;everything&mdash;such
      a world&mdash;such a lifetime! I feel as if my head would burst with all
      the things I remember. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. I&rsquo;m so
      tired, so weary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay it here,&rdquo; Jack said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I laid it on his shoulder, just as I used to do years ago, and cried
      so long in silence, and was ever so much comforted. For I&rsquo;ve
      admitted all along that I&rsquo;m only a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      There we sat, hand in hand, for many minutes more, saying never another
      word, but sympathising silently, till Elsie returned from Palmyra.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she burst into the room, she called out lightly as she entered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got you your lemon, Una, and I do hope&mdash;&rdquo;
      Then she broke short suddenly. &ldquo;Oh, Jack,&rdquo; she cried,
      faltering, and half guessing the truth, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the meaning of
      this? Why, Una&rsquo;s been crying. You bad boy, you&rsquo;ve been
      frightening her. I oughtn&rsquo;t to have left her ten minutes alone with
      you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack rose and held up his hand in warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to her at present, Elsie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      needn&rsquo;t be afraid. Una&rsquo;s found out everything. She remembers
      all now. And she knows how everything happened. And she&rsquo;s borne it
      so bravely, without any more shock to her health and strength than was
      absolutely inevitable.&mdash;Let her sleep if she can. It&rsquo;ll do her
      so much good.&mdash;But, Elsie, there&rsquo;s one thing I want to say to
      you both before I hand her over to you. After all that&rsquo;s happened, I
      don&rsquo;t think Una&rsquo;ll want to hear that hateful name of
      Callingham any more. It never was really hers, and it never shall be. We&rsquo;ll
      let bygones be bygones in every other respect, and not rake up any details
      of that hateful story. But she&rsquo;s been Una to us always, and she
      shall be Una still. It&rsquo;s a very good name for her: for there&rsquo;s
      only one of her. But next week, I propose, she shall be Una Ivor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw myself on his neck, and cried again like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept, Jack,&rdquo; I said, sobbing. &ldquo;Let it be Ivor, if
      you will. Next week, then, I&rsquo;ll be your wife at last, my darling!&rdquo;

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
